<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Not long after the return of the Forty-Fifth
Massachusetts regiment from North Carolina,
an informal meeting of some of the members
of Company A was held in Boston, which
resulted in the formation of a permanent association,
known as the "Co. A Associates of the 45th Regt.
Mass. Vol. Mil."</p>

<p>This association has proved a constant source of
pleasure to its members, and has served to keep in
fresh remembrance the many and varied experiences
of our campaign. The annual reunions are held on
the anniversary of the expedition to Trenton, and
from year to year the friendships which were formed
in the service so many years ago, are renewed. The
presence of some of the officers as invited guests
often adds to the pleasure of the occasion.</p>

<p>Not a little of the success of these yearly meetings
is due to that warm friend of the company and regiment,
Colonel Edward W. Kinsley. As, in the old
war time, no guest was ever more welcome than he,
whether in camp at Readville, on the deck of the
"Mississippi," in the city of Newbern, or on the sand-plains
of North Carolina, so it has been in the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of peace at our reunions. Elected an honorary member
of the "Co. A Associates," the meetings would be
incomplete, indeed, without his cheery presence to
enliven us with reminiscence or song, or, better still,
to give us a bit of the inner history of the dark days
in '62 and '63, with which he is so familiar, and in
which he played so important a part.</p>

<p>The question of publishing a history of the campaign
of the 45th has been often discussed at these
Company A meetings, and a committee was even
appointed to consider the matter. The subject has
also been under consideration in the Regimental
Association, organized some years since. But nothing
was done by either association, until at the meeting
of the Co. A Associates, held in January last, it
was definitely voted to publish a history of our campaign,
with illustrations, and a committee was chosen
for this purpose. This book is the result, and in
offering it to the members and friends of the regiment,
the committee desire to make this explanation.</p>

<p>Shortly after the regiment was mustered out of the
service, one of the members of Company A wrote a
brief history of the campaign, not with any view to
publication, but for his own private gratification, and
to preserve the leading incidents of his army experiences.
He induced another member of the company,
now a well-known Boston artist, to illustrate the manuscript
with drawings copied from sketches taken
during our army life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>This history has been read with interest by different
members of the regiment, and the committee
were convinced that it would be far better to obtain,
as they have done, permission of the writer and artist
to publish, without alteration, this illustrated story of
the campaign, written when the scenes described were
fresh in the mind, than to attempt the publication of
an elaborate history of the regiment, even if it were
possible to induce any member to undertake such a
task at this late date.</p>

<p>In justice to our comrades who have kindly granted
us this privilege, the committee feel sure, if any apology
is needed, that the reader will bear in mind the
fact that this joint effort is the production of their
youth, and not the work of to-day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
CAMP-LIFE AT READVILLE.</h2>


<p>Shortly after the President's call for three
hundred thousand nine months' men, in the
summer of 1862, a meeting was held by the
Independent Corps of Cadets, in their armory in
Boston, to consider the expediency of organizing a
nine months' regiment, of which that corps should
be, as it were, the nucleus. The proposition being
favorably received, application was speedily made to
Governor Andrew by various members in favor of
the movement, for permission to recruit for such a
regiment, under the title of the Cadet Regiment,
but officially to be known as the Forty-fifth Regiment
Massachusetts Volunteer Militia.</p>

<p>Charles R. Codman of Boston, then adjutant of
the cadets, was selected as future commander of the
regiment, subject, however, to the approval of the line
officers, who were themselves to be elected by their
respective companies in accordance with the militia
law of the state, prior to receiving their commissions
from the governor. Recruiting officers canvassed the
state, and the companies ranked in the order in which
their respective rolls were filled.</p>

<p>Readville was selected as the rendezvous and camping-ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
for the regiment, and on the twelfth of
September, Company D went into camp at that place,
followed at intervals by the other companies as they
severally attained a size which would warrant a respectable
appearance on drill and parade.</p>

<p>The camp was pleasantly situated on high ground,
surrounded on three sides by other camps, while the
fourth was skirted by woods, back of which, as a fitting
background, rose the blue hills of Milton in all
their beauty.</p>

<p>We were quartered in barracks, long wooden sheds
running parallel to each other, and perpendicular to
and facing the parade-ground. Back of each barrack,
and separated by a street some twenty feet in
width, were the little cook-houses, while still farther
to the rear were the officers' quarters, quartermaster's
department, etc.</p>

<p>The first night in camp was a novel one to most of
us, and formed the entrance to a new phase of existence,
a military life. We marched from the depot
and were received with shouts of welcome by the
companies already in camp. Halting in front of
the barrack assigned us, the order to break ranks was
the signal for a simultaneous rush of all to take
possession of the movable bunks, which in two tiers
lined both sides of the building, followed by another
stampede after straw to fill them.</p>

<p>My first military duty was the scouring of sundry
rusty pots and pans preparatory to the evening meal.
All the true patriots came into camp with empty
haversacks, determined to brave the soldier's fare at
the outset, and our pride was at its height when,
formed in line, we marched single file to the cook-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and had doled out to us from its window, the
huge slice of bread and dipper of coffee or tea.</p>

<p>"Truly, we are serving our country at last," we said,
and ate our rations without thought of what we had
left behind; but that slice of bread, varied often by
hard-tack, so often, indeed, that the bread was the
exception, and the dipper of coffee soon became an
old, very old story, and the good things at home
would rise in our memories, the ghosts of better
times, and would not down at our bidding, nor would
the hard-tack, either.</p>

<p>The interval between supper and roll-call was
wisely spent in making our bunks comfortable for
the night; and that first night the custom was instituted
by our captain, of reading the lesson and
prayers for the day after morning and evening roll-call;
and was faithfully continued until the regiment
went into tents, some seven months later.</p>

<p>Punctually at nine, taps sounded and the lights
were extinguished, and as reveille was at half-past
five, we naturally desired and expected to lose ourselves
immediately; but alas! for the fallacy of human
hopes, not an eye in that barrack was closed in sleep
a moment before midnight, except, perhaps, that of
one of our number, afterwards discharged for deafness.
The evil one himself was, without doubt, on a rampage
that night, and raised a very bedlam in our midst.</p>

<p>In vain did the orderly threaten; in vain did the
officer of the day, encircled by that mysterious sash
at which we raw ones had gazed with awe, command
silence. For a moment there would be a lull in the
storm, deluding the sober-minded into a belief that
quiet was at length restored, when, with a laugh or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
jest, the uproar would burst forth with redoubled
vigor. Even after sheer exhaustion had quieted the
unruly ones, it was hard to sleep as we lay thinking
over our strange situation, and at intervals through
the night caught the distant challenge of the sentry
at the approach of the welcome relief. But the longest
day must have an end, and at last our weary
eyelids were closed not to open again till the loud
beat of the drum summoned us from the land of
dreams.</p>

<p>With the return of the day our new duties commenced;
some were detailed for camp guard, others
for police duty, but most of us were marched out to
drill, and during our nine months' service this proved
an unfailing source of amusement and occupation, and
was improved to the utmost by the officers.</p>

<p>Police duty has a mysterious sound to the uninitiated,
and those first detailed for that service had their
expectations raised to a great height, but the fall was
so much the more severe. Some were set to work
digging wells, others to sweep up the camp with
brooms of their own manufacture, and one squad
were assigned the task of emptying the barrels in the
rear of the cook-houses, filled with the refuse of the
men's rations; police duty is, in fact, to enact the part
of general scavenger for the camp, a very necessary,
but at the same time disagreeable, business.</p>

<p>Our first day's guard duty was an experience never
to be forgotten. The solitary march back and forth,
back and forth, in the same narrow path, rain or
shine, warm or cold, can only be appreciated after
actual trial. Never did time fly with such tardy
wings as in the night-watches of those dark, wet, fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
nights, when the approach of the relief was to the
weary sentinel like a release from imprisonment. But
those first experiences had their comical side as well.
The awkward manner of handling the guns, the stupidity
displayed in learning the instructions and
duties of the post, and the various mistakes constantly
occurring were laughable to witness.</p>

<p>One day there was a more than usually difficult
subject, whose mistakes furnished a fund of amusement
for the whole guard. After innumerable blunders
during the day, at nightfall he was carefully and
at great length instructed with regard to the countersign,
its object, nature, etc., until the lieutenant of
the guard thought he would be able to pass muster
under the ordeal of the grand round, but the officer,
by skillful questioning, discovered that the countersign
was in his belief a sort of counterfeit bill, which
was to be passed on delivery,&mdash;to say the least, an
original interpretation of the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>But the mistakes and blunders were by no means
confined to the men, for the officers could, without
breach of modesty, lay claim to their full share. One
was particularly noted for his ignorance of military
knowledge, and had earned, among the men, the soubriquet
of "Right Backward Dress," from his repeated
blunders in reference to that order; while another,
having occasion to salute the commandant of the
post, managed to bring his guard to the "present,"
but then gave the order "stack arms," quite regardless
of the intermediate orders essential to a proper
execution of the man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>On pleasant days, guard duty at the camp entrance
was by no means disagreeable, for on such days the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
stream of visitors was unceasing from morning till
night. How we all enjoyed those visits! and the
sight of a friend in the distance was a never-failing
pretext for an excuse from drill or parade. We
were always ready to relieve them of the baskets and
bundles they labored under, and of course they must
inspect the barracks, admire the various decorations
and inscriptions that ornamented the different bunks,
and wonder how any mortal could ever sleep in such
boxes.</p>

<p>One afternoon, two of us were made happy by the
arrival of a carriage-load of friends, who had come to
dress-parade. We both noticed several mysterious-looking
baskets stowed away in the depths of the carriage,
but of course no remark was made as to their
probable contents. After witnessing and duly admiring
the parade, at the sound of the supper-call, the
ladies invited us to take supper with them, if we could
for once deny ourselves the pleasures of the government
commissariat. So, nothing loath, we were armed
with the above-mentioned baskets, and took up our
line of march toward a grassy knoll, back of the
camp and outside the lines, to avoid intrusion, and
there, stretched out on shawls and blankets, we had a
supper worthy of the name.</p>

<p>As we lay about the grass, taking our meal, the
full moon rose in all its beauty from behind the
Milton hills, and lit up the quiet October evening
till the camps and hills were flooded with the silvery
light. The growing dampness warned us at last to
shorten our pleasure, but on taking refuge in the
barrack, we were agreeably surprised by an impromptu
concert from visitors and hosts, and as our regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
boasted some very good voices, the singing formed
an appropriate ending to such a delightful evening.
We enjoyed one or two moonlight evenings in rather
a different way, marching about the camp, headed by
the band, and blundering through some of the simpler
battalion movements for the colonel's benefit.</p>

<p>Our battalion drills in those days were very amusing,
for though in company drill the men got the
blame for all mistakes, yet here the burden of reproof
was shifted to the officers' shoulders, and this was in
some measure a recompense to us, for the laugh was
now on our side. The tortures undergone by the
colonel, in those early days, in witnessing the officers'
oft-repeated blunders, must have been truly excruciating.
Now one, then another, would fall the victim of
his censuring tongue, until, bewildered by the flying
sarcasms and the complication of man&oelig;uvres, their
confusion became worse confounded, and we of the
file, rejoicing over the misfortunes of the rank, would
hail with delight the welcome command of "Drill
is dismissed," screamed forth by the colonel, half an
hour before the usual time.</p>

<p>Nor did we depend on visitors or drill for our
whole stock of amusement. Bathing formed a part
of the daily routine while the weather permitted, and
foot-ball was a favorite occupation during our leisure
hours. Our evenings passed quickly in a quiet rubber
of whist, or in listening to the music with which
the singers often favored us, usually in the barrack,
but occasionally on the mild fall evenings, in the open
air, stretched lazily on the grass before the door.</p>

<p>But the crowning feature of our life at Camp
Meigs was the dress-parade, and this would be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
incomplete history indeed, had that been omitted in
the tale. Very modest in appearance at the outset,
with thin ranks, but two or three drummers and
those far from perfect, and more than all, no guns for
the men; they were gradually improved, now by fresh
recruits, then by the addition of the band, and the
arrival of our Springfield rifles, until, under this combination
of improvements, we were enabled to present
a very respectable appearance.</p>

<p>It seems like a dream to recall the two long rows
of people which night after night stood facing each
other in front of the barracks,&mdash;the actors and spectators.
We come to parade-rest, and the performance
commences. Three groans from the band, then the
inevitable&mdash;the show tune of the band; and as they
come slowly marching down the line, we see a familiar
but ever novel sight. A little in advance of the
band, monarch of all he surveys, and the "cynosure
of neighboring eyes," struts Mariani, the drum-major,
pride of the regiment, twirling his baton, token
of empire, giving that finish to the show which even
our rival neighbors are prone to admire. Never afterwards
did the band play that familiar old tune, No.
45, on the sand-plains of North Carolina, but a smile
ran down the line; and as our thoughts reverted to
the pleasant dress-parades at Readville, we longed for
that opposite row of faces, that we might show our
friends what a good parade was like.</p>

<p>The twenty-sixth of September, eight companies
were mustered into the service of the United States;
and on the eighth of October, the remaining companies,&mdash;together
with the field and staff officers,&mdash;and
we became an organized regiment under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
United States, though constituting a part of the
state militia.</p>

<p>It had been supposed all along that the Army of
the Potomac would be our destination, but when the
44th sailed for Newbern, it became a settled fact
that North Carolina was to be our arena also, and as
the day of departure drew near, every hour of our
short furloughs became precious and the visits of our
friends even more frequent and pleasant than before.</p>

<p>The last Sunday but one, about half the regiment
marched to Milton, and there took the cars for Boston,
where we attended service at Park Street Church, the
church of our chaplain, Rev. A. L. Stone, D. D. After
an appropriate farewell discourse, we returned to camp
much pleased with our trip, with a good appetite for
the regular Sunday dinner in camp of baked beans.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the first of November, the colors
were presented to the regiment by Governor Andrew,
and were received by Colonel Codman in our behalf.
It was a gala day in camp, and the grounds were
covered with visitors, many present for the last time,
as the regiment was under marching orders. In the
evening an impromptu mock dress-parade was quite
successfully carried out, much to the amusement of
the spectators, who still lingered, reluctant to say
good-bye.</p>

<p>The last day or two was full of bustle and confusion
and all who could obtain furloughs were at home,
leave-taking and making their final arrangements.
Wednesday, the fifth of November, dawned on us at
last, raw and disagreeable, and with full knapsacks
and full hearts as well, we bade farewell to old Camp
Meigs, where we had passed a month and a half so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
pleasantly. Perhaps at the time we did not realize
fully all our advantages at Readville, being new to
the life, but we have certainly appreciated them in
the retrospect, and those of our number who may
take the field again will reap the full benefit of their
early experience.</p>

<p>Leaving the cars at the Boston depot, we formed
our line, and escorted by our patrons and godfathers,
the Cadets, marched directly to the Common, where,
on the Beacon mall, a collation was spread to which
ample justice was done.</p>

<p>After receiving our remaining colors from the hands
of the governor (the regiment carried three flags,
United States, State and Regimental), and hearing
addresses, very appropriate, no doubt, but so long that
we were ready to drop with fatigue, loaded down as
we were with full equipments, the last good-byes were
said, and we started en route for the wharf.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a proud moment of our lives, the
march that day through the crowded streets of old
Boston, elate with the consciousness that we were
embarked in a righteous cause, and determined to
play our parts like men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
THE VOYAGE.</h2>


<p>The mere recollection of the nine days passed
on the steamer "Mississippi" is painful, but
it occupied too prominent a position in our
experience to be omitted in this sketch.</p>

<p>After the usual delay on the wharf, attending the
embarkation of a large body of men, we filed on to
the steamer, and were ushered into our respective
quarters. Our company, with five others, were consigned
to the stern of the vessel; so, passing down the
companion-way, deeper and deeper, darker and darker,
until we could, at least, claim a nearer proximity to
China than ever before, we arrived in the hold. As
light was never known to penetrate that quarter, for
two dim lanterns and three air-holes covered with
gratings could hardly be said to afford light, it will
be impossible to describe its appearance. As well as
could be ascertained by touch and smell, the whole
available space was fitted up with bunks, three tiers
deep and of different capacities, holding from one
to four occupants, those comfortably crowded with
three being intended for four, and so on down to
the single ones. All this we learned by the touch,
and at least we will give them credit for making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
most of their room; but our olfactory nerves had
another story to tell; however, we will not particularize.</p>

<p>The other companies were stowed in the forward
part of the vessel, between decks and in the hold,
the band lying wherever they could find space enough.
In addition, five companies of the 46th Regiment
were entrusted to the tender mercies of the "Mississippi,"
and where they were packed is beyond the
power of man to say&mdash;one company, at all events,
was located on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Now all this would have been well enough had we
sailed that night, as was intended, and made the four-day
trip to Beaufort; but no such good luck was in
store, and our initiation was not to be quite so easy.
A heavy northeasterly storm set in, soon after we had
hauled into the stream, and for five days, a tempest of
rain, hail, sleet and snow raged with unceasing fury.</p>

<p>Colonel Codman declared the vessel should not sail
in such a crowded, filthy condition, and the captain
said he could not sail if he would, on account of the
storm, and more than that, there must be a convoy to
protect us from the "Alabama," at that time reported
off the coast. So there we lay at anchor, tossing and
pitching, in plain sight of the city, which only served
to aggravate us in our wretchedness, while near by,
lay our companions in misery, the 43d and the
remainder of the 46th on our consort, the "Merrimac."</p>

<p>Our drinking-water was condensed from salt water
by an apparatus connected with the engine, and was
always in a lukewarm, yellowish state, enough to make
one renounce water forever, and before which Gough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
himself would have stood dumb. A guard, also, was
always stationed over the cask to prevent the men
from drinking too much; whether because the process
of condensation had rendered it more precious
than common water, or from a fear of the men sickening
from a too free use of the vile liquid, is still an
unexplained mystery. May the inventor be condemned
to have it for an eternal drink!</p>

<p>The food given us baffles all attempt at description.
The filthy messes of soup, salt-junk and burnt rice
were boiled in the same huge caldron, and the sight
of the dirty cook added to one taste of the unknown
compound, called by some familiar name calculated
to deceive us, was enough to make one eager to die
of starvation. It was so pleasant, just before dinner,
to be ordered below to await our turn in the long
line, and on the way down, catch a glimpse of the
cabin table, covered with delicacies fresh from the Boston
markets, and when our company was called, to
ascend from the depths of the vessel, cup in hand,
eager for the sumptuous repast doled out from the
great boiler, which, like the magician's flask, furnished
tea, coffee, soup, etc., as desired. Yet all this was on
a first-class transport;&mdash;may heaven take pity on the
poor wretches whose hard fate consigns them to vessels
of an inferior class!</p>

<p>After strenuous exertions by our colonel and some
good friends of the regiment in the city, another
steamer, the "Saxon," was provided for the 46th, and
our own vessel underwent a partial cleansing. We
were also visited by some of the more enterprising of
our friends, who ventured down the harbor in a tug
during the lulls of the storm, and having received an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
invoice of lanterns, books and eatables, we were enabled
to make ourselves rather more comfortable.</p>

<p>We embarked on Wednesday, and on the following
Monday, accompanied by the "Merrimac," "Saxon,"
and the gun-boat "Huron," we steamed down the
harbor just at sunset, overjoyed at the prospect of a
quick voyage and a speedy release from our uncomfortable
quarters. Two or three of us had, in the
course of our wanderings, discovered a cosy little
nook in the extreme stern of the vessel, in close proximity
to the screw, and here, away from the forlorn,
grumbling crowd, which thronged the decks and holds,
with our lanterns, books and cards, we managed to
while away the weary hours quite pleasantly.</p>

<p>The storm had completely exhausted itself, and the
weather was all that could be desired; and though
the slowness of our consort, the "Huron," delayed us
somewhat, yet after we were once fairly started on
our way, nothing occurred to mar the voyage, and on
Friday morning, the 14th instant, the lights of Beaufort
harbor were visible, and our trials on shipboard
were at an end. Our decks were crowded with a
happy company, and an exciting race ensued between
the "Mississippi" and the "Merrimac," for the pilot-boat
which lay off the entrance of the harbor, awaiting
our approach; but, to the chagrin of our captain,
and in fact of us all, the "Merrimac" came out ahead,
and having been boarded by the pilot, proceeded
slowly in advance, the "Mississippi" following closely
in her wake, without delaying for a second pilot.</p>

<p>It was a perfect morning, and the soft, fresh breeze
was very different from the cold wintery blasts we
had left behind us in Boston harbor. Every object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
visible was scanned with curious eyes as we entered
the bay and began to thread the channel, rendered
very intricate by the low sand-bars which lay in every
direction. These were covered with sea-fowl of every
description, while the myriads of ducks which blackened
the water, made us wish for gun and dog with
unceasing and unsatisfied longing.</p>

<p>Two or three gun-boats were riding at anchor in
the harbor, and their sides were lined with a row of
bronzed faces, whose owners cheered us heartily as
we passed slowly by. Fort Macon, of Burnside fame,
soon made its appearance on our left, its guns commanding
both land and water in all directions, and its
ramparts dotted with the garrison who welcomed us
as we drew near. The fort is apparently on an island,
but is really on the point of a long neck of land running
back for some miles before uniting with the
main. It has been greatly strengthened since it
came into our hands, and, in conjunction with the
gun-boats, bids defiance to any foe.</p>

<p>Beaufort lies on the opposite side of the harbor,
and presents a very pretty appearance as seen at a
distance from the water, but does not improve on a
closer acquaintance. The attention is immediately
attracted by a large white building standing on the
very edge of the water, resting under the shadow of
the Stars and Stripes. Formerly the hotel of the
place and the summer resort of North Carolinians, it
no longer echoes to the tread of the <i>élite</i> of Newbern,
but as a government hospital is filled with
the poor fellows parched with the fevers which all
summer infest the sand-plains on the Neuse, and who
doubtless enjoy the cool breezes from the Atlantic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the delicious sea-bath quite as much as those
who formerly thronged the place.</p>

<p>Soon the depot came in sight, and there stood the
long train of platform cars, waiting to convey some of
us to our destination. The idea of spending another
night on the water was almost unendurable, but suddenly
we perceived quite a commotion on the decks
of our leader, and to our great delight it was soon evident
that she was aground. Feeling our way, as it
were, step by step, we drew nearer, and a perfect yell
of exultation went up from our vessel as we glided by
our discomfited rival, and, rejoicing over our victory,
steamed alongside the wharf of what was once the
Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad, but now is
known as the United States Military Railroad.</p>

<p>We were quickly disembarked, and soon closely
packed on the open freight cars, rather a novel mode
of conveyance to most of us, but one to be recommended
as admirably adapted to sight-seeing, and in
pleasant weather both airy and agreeable. Leaving
the 43d and 46th to pass another night on shipboard,
our train was soon on its way to Newbern, distant
about forty miles. Our first stop was at Morehead
City, though why called "city" it would be hard to say,
as it contains but a few miserable houses and a forlorn-looking
hotel, famous as the residence, for a time,
of Company C of the 45th, who were quartered there
as garrison. Every little while a picket-station would
come in view, and now and then a camp whose occupants
greeted us with shouts of welcome and inquiries
as to our State, number of our regiment, latest news,
etc. A blockhouse commanding the bridge over a
small creek was a novelty, and, as long as daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
lasted, we found enough that was new and interesting
to keep our eyes fully occupied. The country itself
through which the road passes is wholly devoid of
interest&mdash;in fact, a vast swamp covered with pine
forests, which extend over a great part of the eastern
section of the state; tar, pitch and turpentine being
correctly given by the geography as among the principal
productions.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when the train drew near the town
of Newbern, and slowly crossing the long bridge
which spans the river Trent, passed up what we afterwards
discovered to be Hancock street, lighted, to
our great astonishment, with gas. We finally came to
a halt before a long freight-house, where a quantity of
oats was stored in bags. This building was assigned
to the right wing as their quarters for the night, and
after our cramped bunks on shipboard, we found the
oat-bags very acceptable. The left wing passed the
night in some vacant tents near at hand.</p>

<p>As we were decidedly cold and hungry after our
ride, the arrival of some of the 44th Mass., with pails
of hot coffee, was very opportune, and we regaled
them with the latest news from home in return for
their kindness. Their description of the hardships
endured on the Tarboro' expedition, from which they
had just returned, did not tend to heighten our
already very far from pleasant impressions of North
Carolina as a place of abode.</p>

<p>As we were taught the productions of North Carolina
in our youth, the negro stood first on the list, and
certainly we had seen no reason to belie that statement.
We had not ceased laughing from the time we
landed, at the comical figures which met us on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
hand. It was the first object to meet our eye at the
wharf, and I doubt not the last thing visible as we left
the shores of Beaufort on our return. We no longer
wondered where the minstrels at the north procured
their absurd costumes; here was material for an endless
variety. It was better than any play simply to
walk about and examine the different styles of dress,
for this was before anything had been done at the
north for the contrabands, and they appeared in the
rags they had brought from their plantations. It was
amusing to listen to the questions which greeted them
from all sides, the bright answers often displaying
more sense than did the questions. Some of our men
seemed to have taken it for granted that all the tales
they had read of the horrors of slavery were the general
rule, and that the great aim and object of every
master's life was to abuse and maltreat the slave in
every possible way. The erroneous and absurd
notions at first entertained by them of the state of
southern society, could only be equalled by the opinions
of our southern friends about the north. One
question asked will serve as an illustration. We were
grouped around a fire that first night, talking with
some bright little contrabands, when one of our number
asked one "If his master ever let him stand by
such a nice fire as that," which in that land of pines
certainly was rather ridiculous, and, for a Boston
boy, rather an insult to his bringing up.</p>

<p>We employed the two or three hours of leisure the
next morning in a tour of inspection through the
town. With our eyes still dazzled with the bright
effulgence of the New England metropolis, and unaccustomed
to the darkness of that benighted land, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
unhesitatingly pronounced it the meanest, dirtiest spot
we had ever set foot in. But it did not take many
weeks of camp life, where the only houses visible
were the barracks and a few miserable negro hovels,
to create a very decided change in our views upon this
subject, as well as on many others of like nature.</p>

<p>The town is very prettily situated at the confluence
of the Neuse and Trent, the former between one and
two miles wide at this point, the latter something less
than a mile. It is laid out quite regularly and abounds
in elms and flower gardens, many of them very beautiful,
and relieving the otherwise ugly streets. We
became better, in fact most intimately, acquainted with
the place when we were quartered there, and a more
minute description will be found further on. Our
first impressions received that morning were, however,
certainly the reverse of pleasant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
CAMP AMORY ON THE TRENT.</h2>


<p>Returning to the freight house where the
night had been spent, we shouldered our
guns and knapsacks and started en route
for our new home. Passing through the town, and
recrossing the railroad bridge, we left the line of the
railroad and took the road running along the edge of
the Trent. After toiling through the sand for about
a mile, we came upon a negro settlement and a long
row of stables, once rebel cavalry quarters, now used
for government team horses and as a sort of wagon
station. An old canal boat, mounting two heavy
guns, commands the spot as well as the surrounding
country, which has been cleared of trees on both
sides of the river to give free range to the artillery.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving this dirty village, the barracks
assigned us came in view, about half a mile up the
river, a most welcome sight, for the day was hot, the
road very sandy and our load heavy. The 17th
Mass. were encamped in tents near by, and as our
regiment approached, they turned out to meet us
and give us welcome. Poor fellows! they looked
forlorn enough, thin and pale, almost all of them
having had the chills or some fever through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
summer, from which they were just recovering, a
great part of the regiment being still in hospital.</p>

<p>On reaching our destination, knapsacks were quickly
unslung, and we hastened to inspect our new quarters.
The barracks&mdash;unlike those at Readville&mdash;consisted
of two long buildings, each arranged for
five companies. They were at right angles with the
river, and parallel to each other, some three hundred
feet apart. The hospital tents were located midway
between the buildings, but after a time the hospital
was transferred to the barracks, rendered vacant by
the detail of two of the companies. The officers
occupied tents, which were pitched away from and
opposite the river, facing and forming one side
of a quadrangle, enclosed by the river, the barracks
and the tents. Beyond the officers' quarters was the
parade-ground, while the drill-ground lay in every
direction.</p>

<p>Directly in the rear of the north barrack, ran the
main road from Newbern south to Beaufort, crossing
the Trent at this point, on what is called the
County bridge. The bridge was commanded at that
time by a little earthwork, called Fort Gaston, which
mounted two guns, to all appearance more dangerous
to those in their rear than in their front; this celebrated
fort was for a long time garrisoned by one man
detailed regularly from the camp guard.</p>

<p>An immense plain stretched out in front of us,
some two or three miles in length, and a mile in
width, bounded in our rear by the river, and skirted
on all sides by fine forests. For the last two or three
years, these have been gradually disappearing before
the axe of the pioneer, thus leaving the approach to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the city from this direction wholly under command
of gun-boats on either of the rivers.</p>

<p>On the edge of the woods, on the opposite side of
the plain, gleamed the white tents of the 23d Mass.,
just relieved from provost duty. The 43d went into
camp a short distance beyond us, and not many weeks
after our own arrival, the 51st Mass. were quartered
in the barracks next beyond ours.</p>

<p>The camp took its name from Colonel Amory of
the 17th Mass., who had command of our brigade,
composed at first of the 17th, 23d, 43d, and 45th
Mass. Later, the 51st Mass. took the place of the
23d, when the latter regiment was ordered into
another department.</p>

<p>The first day or two was spent in establishing ourselves
comfortably in our new quarters, writing letters,
undergoing an inspection by our corps commander,
Gen. Foster, and strolling about the adjacent country,
seeing the sights and making friends with our neighbors,
black as well as white. The camp swarmed with
contrabands of all ages and both sexes, some with eatables
to sell, apples, pies, cakes, biscuit and sweet potatoes,
others wanting to take in washing. The boys
wished to hire out as servants, and at such cheap
rates that we all immediately had one attached to us,
as a sort of body-guard, to run errands, draw water,
wash dishes, and live on our leavings.</p>

<p>The negro huts in the vicinity of the camp were
often visited by the curious, and the mode of life in
them afforded us much pleasure, as it was at the
same time novel and amusing. "Ole Aunt Gatsy"
was quite a favorite with a select few who had
discovered her various excellencies, and we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
indebted to her cuisine for many a nice meal. Her
method of cooking seemed very strange to eyes accustomed
to ranges and stoves, and is worthy of mention.
All the cooking is done at an open wood fire, the
chimney always standing outside the house. The
principal implement of cookery is an iron pot with
short legs and a flat iron cover, somewhat larger than
the mouth of the pot. After raking out a nice bed
of coals, the food, no matter whether a bake, roast or
boil, is placed in the pot over the coals, and the cover
is kept constantly sprinkled with fresh coals until
the contents are cooked. They also use the ordinary
stew-pan, and earthen ovens in which they build huge
fires, and, after the earth is thoroughly heated, put
in the meat or whatever it may be, close both door
and chimney, and in due time produce a joint of
beef, or a dish of baked beans fit for the most epicurean
New Englander.</p>

<p>We soon settled down into a quiet, monotonous life
of drill and guard duty, more wearisome than arduous.
The broad expanse of plain which stretched out before
our camp was large enough for an army to man&oelig;uvre
upon, and the officers certainly made the most of their
opportunity, for company, battalion and brigade drills
followed one another so closely that one had scarcely
time to think in the intervening moments. A very
semi-occasional visit to town served as a pleasant little
episode, by giving us a glimpse of an approach at least
to a civilized existence, thereby preventing us from
wholly lapsing into barbarism.</p>

<p>Nor were our Sundays by any means days of rest;
for as regularly as the day itself, the weekly inspection
of both quarters and men came round. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
amount of cleaning done every Sunday was something
awful. Guns had to be taken apart and made to look
better than when they left the armory, brasses to be
polished, shoes and equipments blacked, and bunks
and barracks put in perfect order. This was varied
occasionally by a knapsack inspection, which consisted
in standing in the hot sun for an hour or two,
our knapsacks on our backs, apparently filled with
all our worldly goods; but appearances are sometimes
deceitful, and so were our knapsacks, but if they only
looked full, we were perfectly content.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we formed a hollow square and had
a regular New England service, with a clear, practical
sermon from the chaplain, finishing the exercises with
the Doxology, in which both band and regiment were
wont to join. The day closed with the usual dress-parade
and a prayer meeting in the evening conducted
by the chaplain.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day being close at hand, most of us
began to busy ourselves making preparations for a
proper observance of the day. Mysterious trips to
town, frequent visits to Aunt Gatsy's, and a great
scarcity of ready money were the most observable
features. Thanksgiving eve arrived at last, clear and
cold, and after the labors for the day were ended, we
built a famous large fire in our barracks, and long
after taps remained grouped about it, talking of home
and former times in old Massachusetts when this
anniversary came round. One by one the men
dropped off to bed, until but four of us remained,
when one of our number proposed whist by fire-light.
The cards were quickly produced, and an impromptu
lunch of crackers and cheese, apples and lemonade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
contributed from our private stores, and there we
played till the waning light of the fire warned us that
our supply of wood was exhausted, whereupon we
crept noiselessly to our bunks, not daring to think
how soon the inexorable reveille would break in upon
our slumbers.</p>

<p>After a sermon in the morning from the chaplain, in
accordance with the good old custom of New England,
the day was given as a holiday, and thanks to
Old Aunty, our little party of six sat down to a repast
which would not have disgraced any board in the
land, and all agreed that we had rarely enjoyed a
dinner more.</p>

<p>About this time, Colonel Codman received orders
to detail two companies for special service, and for
several days quite an excitement prevailed as to which
they were to be. The question was settled by the
departure, on the first of December, of Company C,
for Morehead City, and on the next day, of Company
G, under command of Lieutenant Thayer, for Fort
Macon. Several of the officers and many of the men
were also detached from the regiment about this same
time. Captain Murdock, of Company G, went on to
Colonel Amory's staff, as aide, and Lieutenant
Dewson as Brigade Quarter-Master, his place being
filled by Lieutenant Emmons, of Company E. Lieutenants
Richardson, of Company A, and Blagden, of
Company I, went into the Signal Corps, and never
rejoined their command. The men were variously
distributed, some on signal service, many as clerks at
the various headquarters, assistants in the hospitals,
teamsters, etc., thus materially weakening the regiment
in point of numbers by these heavy details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The first time the men went out on picket they
made preparations enough for an expedition, and bade
good-bye as if at the very least they were sure for
Richmond, instead of simply bivouacing for a night
across the Trent. The truth is, that so far from
resembling that on the Potomac, picketing was with
us rather a pleasant diversion than otherwise. There
were six stations, all on the other side the Trent; the
outermost station directly on the river, the others at
intervals along the road. Each station was under
command of a corporal; and the guard, equipped with
blankets and rations, went out one morning and were
relieved the next. Intended as a safeguard, and
rather for practice than from any real expectation of
an approach of the enemy in that direction, we had
nevertheless, one night, an example of the practical
working and great advantage of the picket guard.
One of the outermost station fired upon what in the
darkness he took to be a body of rebels, and the
alarm was immediately communicated to the camp
guard. The drummers beat the long roll, and in a
very short time the whole camp was aroused, the regiment
in line, and in readiness for the enemy whenever
he saw fit to come. It was well for us, however, that
we did not wait till he did come, but after standing
shivering in the cold night air for about an hour,
went back to the barracks, otherwise we might
have stood there to this day.</p>

<p>The road to Newbern was considerably altered
in appearance by the arrival of General Wessel's division
of New York and Pennsylvania troops from
Suffolk, Va., which encamped about half a mile from
us; and as every day brought news of fresh arrivals, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was very evident that some movement was on foot in
our department. Rumor was very busy about these
times, and the camp was full of reports and stories.
Charleston, Wilmington, and even Richmond itself
were named as our destination. Nothing was thought,
talked, or dreamt of, but the probable expedition, and
if it had ended in talk, our loss under the influence
of undue excitement would have been very heavy.
But about the eighth of December, our feelings were
somewhat relieved by the reading of marching orders
to the regiment, three days being given to prepare for
the march.</p>

<p>The note of preparation sounded through the
camp, and all was bustle and confusion. Knapsacks
were filled to overflowing with all our worldly possessions,
and stowed in a schooner which came up the
river to receive them, so that in case of an attack
or fire in our absence, they at least might be secure,
and indeed such good care did those on board take,
that they have kept some of our things to this day.</p>

<p>It fell to my lot to be detailed on picket the last
day, and so entrusting my property to the tender
mercies of my chum, the guard started for the other
side of the river, wholly ignorant as to whether they
were to be left behind or not. However, having three
old whalers from Nantucket as companions in misery,
the day passed away very quickly, listening to their
tales of sea life, its pleasures and dangers, but above
all, its superiority to the life of a soldier. But my
special wonder and admiration was excited by witnessing
the relish with which they devoured the salt
junk at their dinner, actually preferring it to fresh
beef, to me a most unaccountable taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was bright and clear, and the moonlight
glimmering through the tops of the old pine trees, lit
up the scene just around us, but deepened the blackness
of the shadows which hid themselves in the
surrounding forest. As we sat round the smouldering
embers of the deadened fire, wondering as to our
probable fortune, whether the morrow would behold
us on the march with the regiment, or ignominiously
left behind to guard the camp, our doubts and fears
were set at rest by the arrival of the lieutenant of the
guard. He informed us that at ten o'clock the pickets
were to be taken in, and at that hour we were to proceed
to the barracks as quietly as possible. The hour
came at last, and rolling up our blankets and shouldering
our guns, before long we were once more in
camp.</p>

<p>During our absence all our goods had been removed,
rations distributed, and ammunition given out;
while in anticipation of the hard work before them,
all were sleeping quietly in their bunks, some poor
fellows for the last time. Making all our preparations
for the morrow as speedily as possible, we crawled
upon the boards, and soon forgot our trials in the
land of dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
ON THE MARCH.</h2>


<p>The first tap of the drum at early morn of the
eleventh instant, aroused us with that faint
consciousness of something important before
us, with which the sleeper always wakens on the day
of some long-expected event. The last preparations
were gone through, blankets rolled, canteens filled and
lost straps found, while hurry and confusion reigned
supreme in the various quarters.</p>

<p>At last, everything was in readiness, and as the
impatient drums sounded the assembly call, we
marched out on the parade-ground as if for a review.
The line was formed, with the pioneers in advance,
and with band playing and colors flying, the 45th
started on its first expedition, their hearts beating high
with hope and enthusiasm. On every side of us
trooped our contraband camp followers, laden down
with all manner of strange things, such as the ingenuity
of an inexperienced officer's mind could suggest
as likely to contribute to his wants and comfort,
from a cooking-stove to a shoe-brush. The two
miles of sandy road which lay between the camp and
the town, served in a measure to dampen the ardor of
some of the more demonstrative ones, and more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
one armor vest, which the kind but injudicious care
of friends had provided, was left to rest by the wayside
before the end of those first two miles.</p>

<p>On reaching the city we found the streets crowded
with troops of every description, infantry, cavalry and
artillery, massed together in almost endless confusion.
But after two or three hours delay, the different commanders
began to find their proper positions in the
line of march, and about eleven o'clock of the eleventh
of December, the long column moved forward.</p>

<p>Past Fort Totten, out on the Trent road, the line
for a short time presented an orderly appearance. But
soon there was a bridge to cross, a great puddle to
pick your way around or go splashing through, as
inclination directed; then a stream, whose bridge was
a log on one side, admitting only of single file, the
water, yellow and dirty, looking suspiciously deep for
wading. The unfortunates in the rear had to make
up for these delays by frequent double-quick, until at
length all distinction, not merely of regiments but
also of companies, had disappeared. The march
subsided into a mere race between individuals, all
making for some unknown object ahead, at the highest
rate of speed. On! On! Will the column never
halt, or have the advance suddenly become possessed
of cork legs, which like those in the song, will never
stop, thought the poor fellows on this first morning
of their march, when those fell enemies of the soldier,
sore feet, lame backs and aching limbs, became clamorous
for their victims.</p>

<p>At last, came the halt for dinner, and most of us
experienced a full realization of the blessedness of
rest, while our hard-tack and coffee was like the milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and honey to the Jews. But time and our leaders are
inexorable, and already the lengthening shadows
reprove delay, so once more the hurrying, tearing pace
begins. But now our colonel has made a wise rule,
that on passing any obstacle tending to delay the
rear, the head of the regiment shall halt until the last
company has passed. This prevents the recurrence
of intervals so disheartening for those in the rear
to see opening before them, and requiring an extra
effort to make up the lost space.</p>

<p>We had little leisure that first day to examine the
country about us, but every now and then a deserted
house, the forlorn, desolate appearance of those still
occupied, and the looks of the miserable, half-starved
creatures, who, with undisguised hatred in their eyes,
stood gazing on the moving tide of Yankee soldiery,
gave but too good evidence that the iron hand of war
had been laid very heavily upon this people. Truly,
they were suffering for the sins of their leaders, and
their hatred of the Northern troops was not to be
wondered at, when they slaughtered their cattle, seized
their horses, plundered their poultry yards, and even
entered their houses and snatched the food from their
mouths, without so much as a "by your leave."</p>

<p>Our progress became slower as evening drew near,
and several times the column was obliged to halt to
allow time for the rebuilding of bridges which were
destroyed by the enemy on our approach. Darkness
soon enveloped us, but the weary train still pressed
on. At last, however, our hearts were gladdened by
the distant gleam of light flashing in the horizon, for
we soon learned that it was caused by the fires of our
advance guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Our burden grew lighter as we hurried forward,
refreshed by the sight, and when at last, descending a
hill, we emerged from the woods which skirted its
brow, a scene burst upon our startled vision which, in
its picturesque beauty, almost repaid us for the long
and weary way we had traversed before reaching it.</p>

<p>A large field, stretching for nearly a mile to the left
of the road, was streaked with long rows of fires, made
of dry pitch-pine rails, and as the figures flitted about
midst the fires, weird shadows were thrown against
the black woods and sky beyond. It seemed like
a glimpse into some other world, and when our regiment,
and the many others in the rear, reached the
fairy spot, and added their fires to the grand illumination,
the heavens became red with flame.</p>

<p>Most of us were through with work for that night,
and had no harder task to perform than to collect a
few rails, boil some coffee, and after supper make ourselves
comfortable for the night. But all were not so
fortunate, for some were detailed for picket duty, and
as for the poor pioneers, the enemy, in their retreat,
had laid out several hours' work for them, by felling
trees across the road for nearly half a mile, rendering
it impassable for the artillery. The choppers had
almost completed their job, and had left one huge
old pine, beyond which, preparatory to commencing
the attack, they had built a roaring fire in the middle
of the road. Suddenly, up rode one of the 3d
N. Y. Cavalry, leading a second horse, laden with a
foraged bag of grain. He was very impatient to rejoin
his comrades, encamped some distance in advance of
the main body, and all advice to wait for the removal
of the obstacle proved of no avail. Wheeling about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and riding back a few rods, he started the two horses
on the full gallop, leaped the tree, directly into the
fire, dashed on, and was quickly lost in the thick
darkness beyond.</p>

<p>Refreshed by our night's rest, we were roused at
early dawn by the reveille-call of the bugle, and soon
the whole camp was astir. Breakfast, which, like
both the other meals, consisted of hard-tack and coffee,
except when a successful foraging tour increased
our commissariat, was soon disposed of, and we
started on the second day's march. Wading a broad
stream, at the very outset, relieved us from all fear of
wetting our feet, and enabled us to travel regardless
of mud and water.  We were all becoming more
accustomed to the work before us, though whether
that proved of any practical benefit in rendering the
labor easier, is still an open question.</p>

<p>As we had loaded our guns before starting that
morning, we confidently expected to meet the enemy
before the close of the day; but, though occasional
firing was to be heard at the front, the skirmishing
of our advance with the rear of the enemy, nothing
of the foe was to be seen, except some prisoners captured
by the cavalry, several of them wounded. It
was a sad spectacle, the sight of the poor rebels in
their forlorn condition, so gaunt and filthy, most miserably
clad, and above all, wounded and captive. The
horrors of war were indeed becoming a dread reality
and no longer mere printed words. Another sad
sight was to see the men straggling. Poor fellows,
who, reduced by fever in the summer, and but scarcely
dismissed from the hospital, lined the road, utterly
exhausted and unable to drag one limb after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
other. Others, from our own ranks, unaccustomed to
such hard work, and used up by the march of the day
previous, were compelled to fall out and rest, after an
hour or two of vain attempts to keep up with the
hurrying crowd.</p>

<p>The country grew pleasanter as we advanced, and
food seemed much more plentiful; the woods swarmed
with wild pigs; cattle and poultry were quite abundant,
and occasionally a hive of honey was discovered, and
quickly dismounted and robbed, regardless of its fiery
occupants. Halts were more frequent that day, and
as the camping-ground was earlier reached, the
bivouac was so much the more comfortable. The
night was quite cold, and the ground stiff and frozen
in the morning, but we soon thawed ourselves out
before the rekindled fires. Some of the improvident
ones awoke to a sense of their folly, in having
emptied their haversacks at the end of the second
day, not having considered the simple problem that
if three days rations are eaten in two days, the third
day they must either beg or starve.</p>

<p>We had a very easy day's work on the thirteenth,
for after marching a few hours, firing commenced in
the front, and orders came for us to hurry forward, as
the enemy had made a stand. As we pressed eagerly
onward, the cry was passed along from the rear, of
"Give way, right and left, for artillery!" We were
marching through a long, level stretch of pine forest,
and as the men fell back on each side of the road, we
could see the batteries approaching in the distance.
As they drew near, the leader shouted, "Gallop!" and
on they came, the horses on the full run, the guns
rattling and jumping, the men clinging to their seats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for dear life, to prevent being dismounted by some
extra jounce, but smiling as if going to parade. Cheer
after cheer greeted each successive piece as it rushed
through our ranks on to the front, and we all felt sure
that with such support we could brave any foe.</p>

<p>Leaving the main road, the regiment filed into a
cleared space, where the advance had halted and was
drawn up in line of battle with the rest of the brigade.
The skirmishers advanced and disappeared in the
woods, and we awaited anxiously our orders to move;
but after a few shots from cavalry and skirmishers,
the enemy fell back, leaving in our possession two
small pieces of artillery. It was decided to halt for
the night, to give the men a good rest, as our proximity
to Kinston made a fight the next day almost
inevitable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
OUR BATTLES.</h2>


<p>The quiet afternoon and long night's rest
refreshed us most wonderfully, and we woke
the next morning, Sunday, the fourteenth,
free from all fatigue. It was a bright, beautiful day,
and we broke camp in high spirits, ready for whatever
might happen, and yet with no conception of the
dread realities actually before us, and in which we
were to enact a part.</p>

<p>After marching two or three miles, firing once more
commenced at the front, and hurrying on, the regiment
was halted at the corner of a road which ran
directly to the river Neuse. Presently, a section of
artillery arrived, and passing into a field just before
us, began to shell the woods.</p>

<p>As we waited there, momentarily expecting to enter
the fight already begun, one of our number, amid the
roar of artillery and occasional roll of musketry, began
the hymn, forever associated in the minds of those
present with that scene, "Ye Christian Heroes go
Proclaim," in which we all joined. It was his last
song upon earth, but how nobly did he earn the title
of "Christian Hero," and what death more glorious
than with such words yet lingering on his lips, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
freely surrender his life at the altar of his country's
liberty. His name will ever be cherished with love
and reverence by all who knew him, and we can
rejoice with his friends who mourn his loss, that he is
enjoying his fit reward, an immortal crown of glory.</p>

<p>Soon the order came for the 45th to advance; so,
marching by the right flank, we left the road and
entered the woods, passing directly in front of the
battery, and most unfortunately in its range. Before
notice could be given to the officer in command, two
successive shells had killed three of our number,
besides slightly wounding others. It was a sad omen
with which to enter the fight, but on we pushed and
soon faced to the front and advanced, deployed as
skirmishers.</p>

<p>We quickly found ourselves in the midst of a regular
North Carolina swamp, which in ordinary times
would be considered impenetrable. Mud and water
waist deep, how much deeper none stopped to see,
roots to trip the careless foot, briers innumerable to
make havoc with our clothes, to say nothing of an
occasional stray bullet, which, finding its way through
the trees, whistled over our heads, and contributed to
the pleasantness of the position. But it needed more
than mud and water, or even a stray bullet, to check
us, and so on we crept, crawled and waded, the bullets
becoming thicker as we advanced, until we conquered
the swamp and gained a position where the ground
rose slightly towards the enemy, and was thinly covered
with young oaks and underbrush. Here we
quickly obeyed the order "Lie down!"</p>

<p>The regiment formed in a sort of semi-circle around
the edge of the woods, but the line was too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
extended to be efficient in a charge, as we soon found.
We retained this position for about an hour amid an
unceasing storm of bullets, shot and shell, which,
thanks to the elevation of the ground, passed in a
great measure just above our heads and riddled the
trees in our rear. Too many, however, found a resting
place in a soldier's body, and the dead and
wounded lay in every direction. We fired at will, as
we found opportunity, our regiment, the 10th Connecticut
and 103d Pennsylvania, who following in our
footsteps had gained the same position, all lying together,
regardless of company or regiment.</p>

<p>At last, the order came to fix bayonets, and then to
charge. The left wing, together with the Connecticut
and Pennsylvania troops, sprang to their feet, and with
a loud cry broke from the cover. At the same
moment, the enemy gave way and retreated post-haste
across the bridge which leads to Kinston. But
the extended line of our regiment, scattered as it was
through the woods, and the impossibility of conveying
an order in the din of battle, simultaneously to all
parts of the line, prevented a united movement, and
those who had received and obeyed the order to
charge were soon halted, to enable the scattered ranks
to reunite.</p>

<p>But the day was won, and the rebels, in full retreat
across the river, received an occasional reminder in
the shape of a shell from our guns, which hastened
their speed till it became a run.</p>

<p>We discovered, on emerging from the woods, that
the enemy had been sheltered behind fences on both
sides of the road. This enabled them to concentrate
upon us a cross fire. An old barn-like church had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
also served to protect them in a measure. It was
perforated with holes of all sizes, from that of the
Minie-ball to the one caused by the thirty-two-pound
shell. Dead bodies lay scattered about the floor, and
our surgeons immediately appropriated it for a hospital.</p>

<p>After a time, we marched down the road to the
river, and turning down the Neuse road in the direction
of Newbern, went into camp a short distance
from the bridge. Expecting to bivouac here, we commenced
our preparations for the night. Some of us,
meantime, returned to the swamp to recover our
blankets, overcoats and haversacks, cast aside at the
commencement of the fight, and were fortunate enough
to recover most of them. The dead and wounded lay
scattered through the woods, and with sad hearts we
rejoined our comrades, thankful that our lives had been
spared. But our day's work was by no means ended,
for scarcely had our party returned to the camping-ground,
when the order came to fall in, and off we
started across the bridge, which the rebels had made
a vain attempt to burn in their retreat, and marched
along the banks of the Neuse, till we reached the
town of Kinston.</p>

<p>The strategy which enabled General Foster to win
this battle as easily as he did, was apparent when we
came to understand the nature of the country and
the works of the enemy. The rebels had evidently
expected us to advance by the Neuse road, which runs
along the riverside; for, some distance from the bridge,
a strong earth-work had been thrown up directly
across the road, flanked on one side by a pond, on the
other by a swamp. A long earth-work had also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
erected on the Kinston side of the river, commanding
both roads and the bridge.</p>

<p>The road taken by General Foster rendered the
first mentioned work wholly useless, and the garrison
was compelled to abandon it to prevent their separation
from the main command. The road taken by the
main body of our force makes a bend, which brings
it to the bridge at right angles to the river. Nearly a
quarter of a mile from this bend, a small cross-road
connects with the Neuse road, thus enclosing a square,
in which the enemy made their stand, compelled to
fight on what, to them, was the farther side of the
river, and thus they were made dependent on the
bridge for a means of retreat.</p>

<p>The plan was to divide our force, the main body
keeping straight forward, towards the bridge, and thus
bring on a general engagement, while meantime, a
strong force was sent down the cross-road, in order
to gain possession of the bridge, and so cut off their
sole means of escape. This man&oelig;uvre was only partially
successful, as the rebels, discovering their imminent
danger, gave way before the flanking force had
reached the bridge. However, some five hundred
prisoners were captured, as it was, and eleven cannon
fell into our hands, to say nothing of small arms and
commissary stores.</p>

<p>Some seven thousand of the enemy, under command
of General Evans, were engaged, and not many more
on our side, as many of our regiments took no active
part in the battle. When compared with many other
battles of the war, it was a mere skirmish; but veterans
from the seven-days fight before Richmond, from
Roanoke, and from Newbern, were unanimous in pronouncing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the fire that day, to have been sharper than
was experienced by them in any former battle. General
Foster, in his despatch, speaks of the "terrible
fire" to which we were exposed.</p>

<p>Kinston is rather a pretty place, regularly laid out,
well shaded, and altogether very New England like.
It is built directly on the Neuse, whose banks are
high and steep at this point. We marched through the
town, and halted at the outskirts, on the line of the
railroad, which runs from Newbern to Goldsboro, and
on which most of the enemy made good their retreat.</p>

<p>After the camp had been selected, and our goods
and chattels deposited, the band gave an impromptu
concert, in honor of the victory, after which most of
us started on a foraging expedition, seeking what we
might devour. In this quest we were eminently successful.
Our mess supped on broiled chicken and
apple-jack, and others fared even more sumptuously.
A large quantity of tobacco was also discovered and
speedily confiscated.</p>

<p>Hardly had we finished supper, and laid ourselves
out for the night, when the order came for four companies
to "fall in," and patrol the town. A house in
the middle of the town had been fired, and as the
flames had extended to one or two of the surrounding
buildings, there was a fair prospect of seeing the whole
place in ashes before morning, unless the progress of
the fire was arrested. Fortunately there were enough
firemen to check any further spread of the mischief,
and it devolved upon us to pass the greater half of the
night patrolling the streets, preventing all disorder,
and returning stragglers to their regiments. We
found one fellow in a most happy frame of mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
seated in a horseless chaise, evidently enjoying his
ride intensely, and urging on the imaginary steed, as if
on a race track, apple-jack, without question, having got
the better of him.</p>

<p>The moon came out in full splendor, to light us on
our weary pilgrimage, as we traversed the streets back
and forth, round and round. The captain occasionally
coming to a halt, some of us employed the time by
taking a nap on the sidewalk, or in the road, just as
it happened. A colored gentleman accompanied us
during part of our wanderings, showing off the place,
pointing out the slave market, and other objects of
interest. However, our desire for a more intimate
acquaintance with the town was not so great but that
we were ready to return to camp, somewhere in the
small hours, and wrap up in our blankets for a short
nap, after our day's work.</p>

<p>We were up bright and early the next morning, and
to our surprise, and the enemy's as well, Kinston was
abandoned, and the river recrossed. The rear guard
destroyed the bridge, which had cost us so much effort
to save the day before, and we started once more in
the direction of Goldsboro. It was very warm and
dusty, and the march long and wearisome, but the
country grew pleasanter the further inland we advanced,
and the plantations appeared much more flourishing,
so that we were more than usually rejoiced to reach
the camp that night, and rest after our two days of
hard work.</p>

<p>After marching three or four miles the next morning,
Tuesday, the 16th, the boom of cannon, now quite
familiar, was heard in the distance, and orders came
for the 45th to hasten forward to the scene of action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
The road runs for some distance parallel to the river,
through a large clearing, and then turns abruptly
towards a bridge which spans the Neuse, leading to
the town of Whitehall. The land rises to some
height on the left side of the road, the brow of the
hill being thinly covered with forest trees, while on
the right it slopes to the wooded bank of the river.</p>

<p>On the approach of our cavalry advance, the previous
night, the rebels had crossed the river, destroying
the bridge in their retreat, and the fighting was
now going on at this point, the apparent object being
to rebuild the bridge, and cross the river. The part
taken in this fight by our regiment was rather passive
than active, but none the less trying for that reason.</p>

<p>A portion of a New York battery being put in
position on the rise of the hill, we were ordered to
their support; so, marching along the road till opposite
the battery, we formed in line of battle, and then lay
down, facing the river, and not many rods distant
from it. Our situation was anything but an agreeable
one, for not only did the rebel shot and bullets fall
thick around us, but the shell from our own guns
behind, passed so near as to render a recumbent posture
very desirable. An hour passed in this condition,
without firing a gun, seemed, from the very inaction,
much more like two or three; but at length the order
was passed along the line to fall back to the other side
of the road. So, crawling through, or scrambling over
the fence which separated us from the field, we took
up a new position, two or three rods further back, and
directly the 3d Rhode Island Battery came thundering
down the road, and unlimbering on the spot we had
just vacated, began to pour a deadly fire across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
river. While we occupied this position, our gallant
Color Sergeant, Theodore Parkman, was struck in the
head by a fragment of a shell, and almost instantly
killed. But before the colors fell to the ground they
were seized by the colonel himself, and though a
mark for the deadly missiles of the sharp-shooters,
which whistled close around him, he supported them
till relieved by one of the color-guard.</p>

<p>It is true we accomplished the destruction of a gun-boat,
which was in process of construction at this place,
but all this apparent effort to cross the river was
merely a feint to occupy the attention of the enemy,
and thereby cover a raid of the cavalry upon the Goldsboro
and Wilmington Railroad. It was most successful,
for a battalion of the 3d New York having struck
the road at Mt. Olive Station, took the people wholly
by surprise. They came upon a crowd of passengers
waiting for the train, which was, however, unavoidably
detained on that day, at least, as they destroyed the
track and telegraph for some miles, rejoining the main
command without the loss of a man.</p>

<p>We marched on some hours after the fight was over,
finding the country much more hilly, and decidedly
pleasanter. The latter part of the day, a few of us,
wearying of the monotony of the march, started ahead
on our own account, passing regiment after regiment.
An occasional meeting with old friends among the
Massachusetts troops, with whom we rehearsed the
events of the past two or three days, created quite a
pleasant diversion, and relieved to a great extent the
tedium of the way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
THE RETURN.</h2>


<p>Up to the last day's advance, our brigade had
been one of the first in line of march, but
that last day the 45th was detailed as guard
over the baggage train. We were consequently prevented
from participating in or even witnessing the
battle at the bridge where the railroad crosses the
Neuse, a short distance from the town of Goldsboro,
which resulted in the destruction of the bridge.</p>

<p>Our regiment was drawn up in line by the road-side,
awaiting orders, when General Foster and his
staff came riding up from the scene of action. The
general himself announced the successful accomplishment
of the object of the expedition, which good news
was received with loud cheers, followed by a salute
from the band.</p>

<p>At nightfall, on the return march, we had just
reached the bivouac of the previous night, when
firing was once more heard in the direction of Goldsboro,
and presently an orderly dashed up with orders
for us to hurry back, as an attack in force had been
made by the enemy on our retiring column. This
was anything but agreeable, as we were anticipating
a good supper and a quiet night; but war is inexorable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and so we faced about and hurried off on the
back-track. At the end of four miles, the firing
ceased, and soon word came that we were not wanted,
and might once more turn our faces homeward.</p>

<p>By this time it was quite dark, and the men very
naturally felt cross and tired, and did not execute some
order of the colonel as promptly as he thought right.
Whereupon, he treated us on the spot to a drill in the
manual, full fifteen minutes long. Our way back to
camp was lit up by the blazing fences and pines which
had caught from the fires made by the troops along the
road at the various halting places, and presented a
beautiful appearance, yet at the same time the scene
was not wholly free from danger, as the burning trees
were falling in all directions. The sky was red with
the blaze, and it was a grand sight to watch the fire
creep slowly up the trunks of the old dead pines, towering
high above the other trees, and gradually envelope
them in one sheet of flame.</p>

<p>The next day we were fully initiated into the mysteries,
as well as duties, of baggage guard. Four men
were detailed to a wagon, two on each side, and off
start the teams, most of them empty, at a rate of about
ten or twelve miles an hour. Running beside the
wagon was rather severe exercise, and sitting with the
driver almost an impossibility, strict orders being given
by the wagon-master to allow no one to ride. There
was, therefore, nothing to be done but let them go
their own gait, or else climb up and cling to the
inverted trough, used in feeding the horses, which hangs
at the back of most army wagons. The wise ones
chose this latter course, and by constant practice
acquired great expertness in getting on and off while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
at full speed. At length, by judiciously walking up
the hills, occasionally presenting ourselves at the front
of the wagon to show the driver we were on hand, and
assisting in watering the horses, we worked on his
feelings to such an extent that a seat by his side
crowned our efforts. Our good fortune was, however,
but short-lived, for the wagon-master, on discovering
our comfortable position, most unceremoniously ejected
us therefrom, leaving us to finish the journey on foot,
for which kind act he has our grateful maledictions.
Rations began to run very low about this time, and
the houses on the road were very thoroughly searched
and stripped of all things eatable.</p>

<p>Our column presented a most singular appearance
on the return march, for each one seemed to be his
own commander, and all thoughts of company or regiment
were wholly thrown aside. A most motley
appearance we must have presented. Here comes
one mounted on a nice horse, with a halter for his
bridle, a blanket for his saddle; another has found
a home-made cart, into which, by dint of rope and
strap, he has fastened some old Rosinante, a perfect
match for the vehicle, and thus rides in state in his
own carriage. There is a mule, which in its obstinacy
causes the rider much more trouble, and consumes
more time, than an equal amount of walking; while a
strange crowd on foot, their faces black with the accumulation
of nine days' dirt, armed with plunder of
every shape and kind, from a sauce-pan to a feather
pillow, hurry along, each one suiting his own convenience
and acknowledging no other leader.</p>

<p>It was a pretty hungry time for a day or two, and
for one forty-eight hours but four hard-tack to a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
were issued by the quartermaster, and those who were
unsuccessful in their foraging went very hungry. The
officers fared no better than the men, as the following
incident certainly bespeaks a most sharp and
craving appetite. After we had gone into camp, on
one of these nights of scarcity, a lieutenant in our regiment
was prowling supperless about the staff headquarters,
and in the course of his wanderings came
upon a contraband making a supper off the remains
of the mess-table. Called away for a moment, he laid
down his dish, leaving on it a bone not thoroughly
picked; but alas for the poor darkey! when he returned,
the bone was gone, and his feast was over, while the
lieutenant alone remained to tell the story.</p>

<p>Our expedition had its pleasures as well as its pains,
and though perhaps not as numerous, yet they were all
the choicer for their rarity. Passing through a strange
country, where houses and people differed from what
we were accustomed to, every object was novel and
full of interest. Foraging was full of charm, not only
because of the excitement it afforded, but from its
utter lawlessness. It was something so entirely opposed
to all civilized proceedings, to boldly enter a house
and demand and take something to eat, or deliberately
walk off with a goose or chicken, without so much as
"by your leave" to the owner.</p>

<p>Then this wild, out-of-door life; lying close to old
Mother Earth, with the blue canopy of heaven for our
covering; the merry camp-fires, surrounded after a
day of toil by a circle of weary but contented faces,
busy preparing supper. The more enterprising ones,
who had been successful in their foraging, cooking
their chicken or hoe-cake, or perhaps a bit of bacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
filched from some smoke-house, while the unlucky or
lazy ones have only to boil their coffee and make a
meal off of hard-tack, when they have any. Every
little while a shout of dismay is heard as some luckless
wight stumbles over the end of the long rail which
stretches out into the darkness, but on whose fire-end
are nicely poised two or three cups of coffee, almost
ready to drink, and their unfortunate owner sees the
precious contents spilled into the fire. It was no
small trial of temper, after going perhaps half a mile
at the end of a wearisome march to fill your canteen
with water, to lose both water and coffee by the awkwardness
of some stupid fellow. The only equally
provoking accident is, to have your blanket-straps give
way while wading a mud-puddle, and see the blankets
fall into the mud.</p>

<p>The fine weather, with which we were favored, was
another pleasant feature of the expedition. The nights
were cold, to be sure, but the air was clear and bracing,
and we were spared all the discomforts of a stormy
campaign. We learnt more of the true character of
our comrades also, for nothing brings out the real worth
of a man more than such an experience. Some, who
had been very stout and bold-hearted in the anticipation,
sank utterly under the reality; while others, from
whom little had been expected, now appeared as lively
and active as if on a pleasure excursion, and occasionally
you would see a noble-hearted fellow carrying two
guns, or an extra set of blankets, but for whose kindly
assistance some poor fellow would have given up in
utter despair.</p>

<p>One of the saddest sights of the march was the
great number of stragglers. We read in the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of so many stragglers picked off by guerillas, or
captured and missing, and one naturally supposes that
these unlucky ones have wilfully strayed from the
command, and suffered the penalty for their carelessness
and disobedience. But what is the reality? As
the column goes hurrying by, you catch a glimpse of
a pale face lying by the road-side, faint and weary; a
few steps farther on, one with his shoes off, bathing
his blistered feet; here is a poor fellow whose summer
has been spent in hospital, sick of a fever, and whose
little stock of strength is soon exhausted; these are
the stragglers who reach the camp long after the
others have made themselves comfortable for the
night, and, after a restless night, they start off the
next morning with a like prospect before them, until
human endurance can hold out no longer.</p>

<p>On the tenth night we found ourselves but eight
miles from Newbern, and the next morning we started
for the barracks with happy, thankful hearts. About
noon of the eleventh day, after a march of more than
one hundred and fifty miles, a motley crew, some with
faces which had known no water during our absence,
and all unshaven, tattered and torn, we once more set
foot in Camp Amory on the Trent. After the luxury
of a bath and change of clothes, we had a great treat
in the budget of letters and pile of boxes which had
been awaiting our return, suggestive of numberless
feasts, to make up for the scanty fare on the march.
Such was our first experience of the stern realities of
war. Out of the eight companies who went on the
expedition, seventeen men were killed and sixty
wounded,&mdash;one in every ten of the command.</p>

<p>We soon fell into the old routine of camp life, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
regimental library furnishing a supply of reading for
the evening hours, and when reading and writing
failed, whist was always on hand, a never-failing
resource. Not long after our return to camp, the
regiment, in common with many others which were
quartered in barracks, was visited by a deadly malaria,
which carried off several brave fellows who had escaped
the dangers of the march only to fall victims to disease.
As one after another was stricken down, and in a
few short hours lay cold and still in death, a shadow
fell upon us all, for none could tell whose turn would
come next. We entered the service with the dangers
of the battle-field distinctly before us, but
this was a foe against which mortal might was
powerless. There is a glory in a death in battle,
but equal honor and equal praise is due to him who
suffers for his country's good in a different way, and
at her call gives up his life on the sick-bed, with
a heroism equal to those who shed their lifeblood
in the fight. All honor and praise be to
both.</p>

<p>Being exempted from drill the day after guard duty,
we used to make little excursions about the country;
through the woods on the opposite side of the river,
hunting after brier-root to make pipes, and also to
collect logs for the barrack fire; to the old brick house,
once the mansion-house of the plantation upon which
our camps were situated, now torn down, and the
bricks converted into chimneys and ovens for the
barracks, while the surrounding grove has fallen
before the axes of the pioneer. Still farther off,
stood the blockhouse on Brice's Creek, the outpost
in this direction, a favorite resort, while near by was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a signal-tower, from which a fine view of Newbern
and the vicinity could be obtained.</p>

<p>Christmas came, marked by an absence of drill, and
an extra dinner, followed by the New Year's day, so
memorable on account of the Emancipation Proclamation
that day given to the world. But a very
important event, and one long looked for, occurred
early in January, which sent a thrill of joy throughout
the department,&mdash;that was the arrival of the paymaster
and our first pay-day. He had been coming
every day for many weeks; and some regiments had
not been paid for more than six months, and their
families were suffering for want of this dearly-earned
money. But come he did, and a happy set of faces
filled the long line as it filed by his table, receiving
the first earning in Uncle Sam's service. But
transcendent in his joy was the sutler, who, seated by
the paymaster, eyed the crisp bank-notes, and speculated
how soon they would find their way into his
rapacious maw.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
A TRIP TO TRENTON.</h2>


<p>We had but fairly settled down to the old
story of drill and parade, our lameness
healed, and the excitement of the scenes
through which we had so lately passed somewhat
allayed, when rumors of another expedition began to
float about the camp. These were vague at first, but
increased in strength from day to day, until we became
convinced of their truth by the announcement at dress-parade
of the order to be in readiness on a certain
day, with three days' rations ready cooked. Having
learned wisdom by experience, we understood better
how to prepare for a march. My first care was to
procure a body-guard in the shape of a stout contraband
youth, to relieve me of my blankets and look
after my interests generally; the next was to make
some provision for the inner man, additional to that
of government, which had failed us before in the hour
of need. Thanks to a box from home, a ham, not
quite demolished, made an excellent substitute for salt
junk, and a package of rice also found its way into our
haversack. This possessed the double advantage of
furnishing great nourishment and occupying but a
small space in the bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Several gentlemen from Boston, who had arrived
shortly before our departure, had an opportunity of
seeing the regiment leave camp on an expedition.
Our force consisted of one brigade of infantry,&mdash;1st
Brigade, 1st Division, 18th Army Corps,&mdash;a
squadron of cavalry, with a small howitzer, and a
section of artillery, all under command of Colonel
Amory, our brigade commander. Two or three unsuccessful
attempts to start had been made, as a storm
prevented, but Saturday, the 17th, dawned, a clear,
cold January day, and shortly after breakfast we left
camp and were soon fairly on our way. While awaiting
the arrival of the detachment of cavalry and artillery
which was to accompany us, a very amusing scene
occurred, in the shape of an extempore drill by some
of the contrabands&mdash;our camp followers&mdash;under the
leadership of a deep-voiced darkey, whose orders were,
to say the least, remarkable: such as, "In three ranks
count twos, Right smart, Git!" while the execution of
these man&oelig;uvres was, if possible, even more ludicrous
than the orders themselves.</p>

<p>The first day's march was through an uninteresting
section of country, very sparsely settled, and more
hilly than any we had passed through before. The
march was quite reasonable, bringing us to the village
of Pollocksville, distant a little more than twelve miles
from Newbern. The town comprised only about half-a-dozen
houses, remarkable solely for their homeliness.
The place, however, once boasted a private
school of some pretensions. The large white building,
not far from the town, standing a little distance
from the road, immediately attracted our attention,
and a halt occurring just then, we made an inspection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Some circulars were found setting forth the merits of
the school, and advising parents not to let the distractions
of war interfere with the education of their children.
But teachers and scholars had alike disappeared
long since, and the building alone remained, forlorn
and desolate.</p>

<p>As we entered the village, two or three men were
seen in the distance, and some of the cavalry immediately
dashed off at full run in hot pursuit, but, having
gained the woods, they made good their escape. The
half-dozen houses were mostly deserted, and extensive
levies were made upon them for boards, which, covered
with a sufficient number of weeds and stalks, made a
bed fit for a king, and almost too luxurious for a soldier.
Taking it quite leisurely the next morning, as
some trees felled across the road caused delay,
we started <i>en route</i> for Trenton, leaving part of our
force to guard the baggage-train which remained at
Pollocksville.</p>

<p>This day's march was, without exception, the pleasantest
in all our experience. We were not hurried, as
always before, and had some opportunity to look about
and see the country through which we were passing.
This section had been very little disturbed by raiding
armies; the plantations grew larger the further we advanced,
and the houses had a very comfortable, hospitable
appearance, but as foraging was strictly forbidden,
a close inspection was out of the question. For some
distance the road skirted a cypress swamp, a most desolate,
gloomy spot, the old trees, hoary with the long
gray moss which hung in festoons from every limb,
and surrounded with slimy water, suggestive of snakes
and horrible reptiles,&mdash;secure retreat for the fugitive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Our command entered Trenton without opposition,
a small force of the enemy retreating in hot haste on
the approach of our cavalry. After going into camp
and disposing of our luggage, we wandered about the
town, seeking what we might devour, but finding little
to reward us for our pains. The town is prettily situated
on the river Trent, but the houses and people
were forlorn and dirty enough. The post-office was
ransacked, but little besides recruiting bills was to be
found. One great object in coming to this place was
to destroy the bridge across the Trent, and so prevent
any advance on Newbern from this direction. Our
arrival was a happy event for the slaves in and about
the town, and they spent the night in preparation for
their exodus from the land of bondage. The bridge
burned, we started on the back road, accompanied by
a long train of contrabands. A mill at the entrance
of the town was fired to prevent the use of its timbers
for the reconstruction of the bridge, and as the groan of
the machinery rose above the roar of the flames, we
could imagine it some huge creature awaiting in
agony a fiery death.</p>

<p>The next night we spent at our old camp at Pollocksville,
and very narrowly escaped quite a serious
disaster; for the grass in the large field where we
encamped, being quite high and dry, took fire, and
burned with such violence that it was only by great
exertion that we saved our guns and traps from
destruction. With replenished haversacks, we made
a fresh start the next morning in the direction of
Onslow Court House, following in the tracks of the
cavalry, who had started the previous afternoon with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
two pieces of artillery. Early in the afternoon we
reached a place called Young's Cross Roads, where
the cavalry had captured an army wagon and a few
prisoners. Here we bivouacked, and as the sky
looked threatening, made preparations for a stormy
night, for we were to await the return of the cavalry,
or, if needful, go on to their support.</p>

<p>While hard at work, making as good shelter as possible
with boards and rubber blankets, round came
the orderly with the detail for picket duty, our name
among the rest; so, dropping rails and boards, and
once more donning our harness, we reported with our
squad to the officer of the guard. The road we were
detached to guard led to some mills,&mdash;Packard's, by
name,&mdash;and every little while three or four men were
dropped off under charge of a corporal, until the
lieutenant announced that the next station would be
the reserve, with a guard of twenty. Such of our
company as were detailed on guard, were among this
lucky number, and we quickly set to work to prepare
our camp.</p>

<p>Fortunately the spot selected was opposite to a
clearing where there were several large piles of rails,
ready for use. These were immediately appropriated
and rigged up for a roof and floor. Meanwhile, some
of the party, sent on a foraging expedition, returned
with a supply of sweet potatoes and their tin cups filled
with delicious honey. As we were at work, an old
darkey came along in an ox-team with meal from the
mill, and the poor fellow was unlucky enough to have
on a rebel overcoat, the buttons of which quickly disappeared
under the knives of trophy seekers. On
coming to the main camp the meal was confiscated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
so the old man decided that he would rather go with
us to Newbern than face his master's wrath.</p>

<p>As night came on, the sky grew blacker and blacker,
and at length the storm burst upon us in all its fury.
For a time our arrangements worked nicely, and our
rubber blankets formed a good protection overhead,
but after a while the rain discovered the weak spots,
and little streams of water began to trickle into our
faces and run down our backs. Sleep was out of the
question, so we all got up and huddled about the
embers of the smouldering fire, but to little purpose.
The heavens seemed literally to have opened their
flood-gates, and the floods descended. If we stepped
off the rails we immediately sank knee-deep in mud,
and our beds would have delighted the soul of the
most fastidious porker; drenched from head to foot,
with no prospect of even a wink of sleep, we waited
as patiently as might be for the coming day.</p>

<p>Towards morning the storm abated in violence;
so we built up a roaring fire, and made ourselves comparatively
comfortable, our spirits returning with the
light, and by ration time we were as bright as if we
had passed a most delightful night. Having dried
our clothes and blankets as well as the circumstances
permitted, about nine o'clock we rejoined the regiment,
most of whom had been drowned out in the
night, and suffered an experience similar to our own.
The cavalry had returned in the night, after riding
about thirty miles, their progress having been stopped
by the burning of a bridge near Onslow Court
House. They were followed back by a long procession
of contrabands, with faces turned eastward.</p>

<p>About half-past nine that same morning, we started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
on our return march. The rain had subsided into a
fine drizzle, and the roads were somewhat inclined to
be muddy. The head of the column pushed along as
though hotly pursued by the enemy, stopping for about
twenty minutes at the end of the first five miles. We
hurried on through Pollocksville without halting, taking
a breathing spell and dinner just beyond the village,
and then the fun commenced. Mud was king
that day. Not like our New England mud, barely
deep enough to soil your boots, but real old Southern
mud, fathomless, immeasurable. Every little while
we were greeted with solemn farewells by unfortunate
ones disappearing rapidly from view, bound on a terrestrial
voyage to China by the air, or rather earth,
line. One poor wretch, stepping into a deceitful puddle,
descended to his waist; then, unable to proceed
either up or down, concluded to remain where he was,
for want of a better place, until, having furnished
much sport to the crowd, two of his comrades, taking
pity on his helpless condition, seized him by the
shoulders, and landed him once more on <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>Every mile or two, streams, intended for peaceful,
babbling brooks, but which, swollen by the rains, had
became raging torrents and angry rivers on a small
scale, crossed the road. Some we forded, others we
waded for lack of better means of transit. Occasionally
rail bridges spanned the stream at the side of the
road, tempting the unwary one, and some unlucky
one would now and then disappear from them into
the roaring flood, and emerge looking quite moist and
crestfallen, with his gun in excellent order for use.
Little streaks of clay cropped up here and there along
the road, holding the feet as in a vice, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
lucky who retained his shoes in the struggle. Still,
on rushed the van, as if life itself was at stake, if camp
were not reached at an early hour; so, resigning
ourselves to our fate, we tumbled along with the rest.
The column must have resembled in appearance the
army in the stampede of Bull Run. Every man running
a race with his neighbor, all discipline thrown
to the winds, and the one who reached camp first,
the best fellow.</p>

<p>Although, without exception, the hardest day in all
our campaign, we never had a merrier one. There
were more jokes in that afternoon than in an ordinary
month; and it may be set down as an axiom, that,
in the army, the harder the work, and the more dismal
the circumstances, the better humor the men will
be in. But all misery has an end, and so did ours;
for, about five o'clock that Saturday afternoon, we
found ourselves safe and sound in the old barracks,
without having fired a gun or lost a man. So ended
our second expedition, we having on this last day
marched, in a little more than seven hours, including
all halts, twenty-one miles, on the muddiest road it
has ever been our lot to see, or hope to see, disfigure
the face of the earth.</p>

<p>In addition to the letters from home, pleasing rumors
greeted us on our return, to the effect, that, for a time
at least, we were to know no more expeditions, but
were soon to take up our quarters in Newbern as provost
guard. After time to rest and discuss this good
news in its every possible feature, we were rewarded
for past labors by the reading of the order for the
45th Mass., Colonel Codman commanding, to relieve
the 17th Mass., at Newbern, on the 25th instant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
The intervening time was spent in preparations for
departure, collecting our numerous movables, taking
down shelves, hiring donkey-carts, etc., and on the
24th we retired to our bunks in old Camp Amory
for the last time, the anticipation of the morrow
engrossing every thought, and rendering sleep of little
moment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
LIFE IN NEWBERN.</h2>


<p>At an early hour on the long-expected day, the
detail for guard left the camp, and soon after
breakfast, the rest of the regiment started, in
the best possible spirits, for its new quarters, making
quite a triumphal entry into the captured city, with
band playing and colors flying. Crossing the railroad
bridge, we marched directly to Broad street, the
parade-ground of all troops occupying the city. There
the out-going regiment, the 17th Mass., were drawn
up in line to welcome the new-comers; and after the
customary man&oelig;uvres required by military etiquette,
the command of the city was tendered to Colonel
Codman, and the companies ordered to their respective
quarters.</p>

<p>The lines of Company A had ever fallen in pleasant
places, and our good luck did not desert us, for we
found ourselves in possession of the nicest of the
houses assigned to the regiment; in fact, one of the
prettiest places in the town. It was a two-storied,
wooden building, on Pollock street, the principal
street of Newbern, lighted with gas, but of course
wholly destitute of furniture. It had flower-gardens
in front and on both sides, while in the rear were one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
or two acres of land covered with various kinds of
fruit-trees, several fig-trees among the number. There
was also a cook-house, barn, and out-buildings, all,
except the barn, fitted up with bunks for the accommodation
of those who could not obtain a corner in
the main building.</p>

<p>All the rooms in the house, excepting those reserved
for the officers, were lined with bunks, the parlor alone
having seventeen occupants. The name of "Pierce"
still adorned the front door, and we would embrace this
opportunity to tender to the individual rejoicing in the
name of "Pierce," our most sincere thanks for the
noble manner in which he retired to the country and
generously yielded up his house and grounds, rent
free, to the use of the Yankee soldiery.</p>

<p>Company K occupied the next house, and opposite
them were the quarters of Company D, while across
the street was the house occupied by General Hill,
the rebel commander, for his headquarters when in
the city. Just below, on the next corner, was the
building employed by the provost marshal, and the
headquarters of the provost guard. The companies
were somewhat scattered, for the greater security of
the city.</p>

<p>The duty of the provost guard was somewhat as
follows. The city was divided into three districts; the
first district was the south-eastern part of the town,
and embraced the business quarter, having its headquarters
at the provost marshal's. Here was the
guard-house, where all persons arrested were kept till
examination was made and sentence passed over them,&mdash;like
the station-house of the police. The second
district comprised the northern portion of the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
having its headquarters in the old office of the Atlantic
and North Carolina Railroad. This was situated next
the depot, and the desk and safe of the company
remained in their old places. General Foster's headquarters,
and the house occupied by his family, were
in this district, and under the especial care of the
guard. The third district covered the remainder of
the town, the south-western portion, and was the
least important of the three.</p>

<p>The daily detail for guard was as follows: One captain,
three lieutenants, three sergeants, ten corporals
and one hundred and ninety-seven privates. The
absence of two companies, G and I, and the large
number of men on detached service, rendered the duty
of the privates quite arduous, as the large detail necessitated
their going on guard every other day, with an
occasional interval of two days; but the officers, non-commissioned
as well as commissioned, had a very
easy time of it.</p>

<p>Guard-mounting took place on Broad street, every
morning at eight o'clock, and was quite an attraction
for idlers, the band always taking part. After the customary
man&oelig;uvres, each lieutenant marched his guard
to the district assigned him, so that it was nearly ten
o'clock by the time the old guard was relieved and
returned to quarters. The men at the head of the
line were assigned to the first district, and as that was
the most popular of the three, there was a regular
race every morning for the first place, and sometimes
an enterprising company would be on hand half
an hour before the required time. But, after a while,
the companies alternated in their position in the line,
and so all competition was at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The guard was divided into three reliefs; the first
being on duty from nine to one, both morning and
night; the second from one to five, and the third from
five to nine. The first relief was through with its
labor at one o'clock <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, while the third had the
whole night from nine to five to sleep, and the day
to loaf, so the choice between these two was about
equally divided, but the second relief, being a sort of
nondescript, was scouted by all.</p>

<p>There were two detached stations, both under command
of a corporal, which were very much liked by
the men. The first was at the railroad bridge, which,
as the main entrance to the city, for all on foot or
horseback, was an important point. More than one
poor corporal lost his stripes when at this post, for
some slight dereliction of duty. There were sentry-boxes
on the bridge for stormy weather, and a cosy
little guard-room with a nice bed of shavings,
much more comfortable than the hard boards in the
other guard-rooms. No one was allowed to pass
over the bridge in either direction without a permit,
and special instructions were issued against allowing
any vehicle to cross without an order from department
headquarters.</p>

<p>The other station was at the Pollock Street
Jail,&mdash;jail in name, but nothing but a large wooden
dwelling-house. It was occupied by rebel prisoners,
disloyal citizens, and occasionally by a United
States officer under arrest. The jailer was a great
burly corporal of the 23d Massachusetts, who was
afterwards promoted to a lieutenancy in the North
Carolina native regiment. The guns of the sentries
here were always loaded, and the orders were to shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on the slightest attempt to escape,&mdash;a very necessary
precaution, where but two men kept guard over a house
having at times as many as sixty prisoners. Their
fare was the same as that furnished to our men,
and often better. The prisoners brought in were for
the most part a wretched-looking set of men; dirty
to filthiness, ragged, ignorant and stupid, many of
them the clay-eaters of North Carolina. There was
a rebel surgeon confined there for a long time, an
intelligent, educated man from New Orleans, with
whom we had many a talk on the topics of the day,
upon which he kept himself well informed.</p>

<p>There was a great choice in the sentry-stations
over the city, and the men very quickly became
acquainted with their various excellences and respective
merits. Some were under cover, others were not
needed at night; at this one a breakfast was furnished
by a kind neighbor, at another, the guard was sure of
some dinner, while some were wholly undesirable,
being on some bleak, unprotected corner, exposed to
wind and rain.</p>

<p>Guard duty had sufficient variety to relieve it
from monotony, and while many a ludicrous scene
happened, occasionally, occurrences not wholly devoid
of danger, served to keep us alive. Some one would
report a disturbance, and ask for a guard to restore
peace; whereupon volunteers would be called for,
and two or three start off, ready for anything that
might turn up. Some drunken soldier has, perhaps,
made himself at home in a house, to the obvious discomfort
of the inmates, and refuses to be dislodged;
but the ugly look of the bayonet soon brings him to
terms, and he is marched off to the guard-house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
allowed an opportunity to consider his evil ways,
in solitary confinement. Occasionally, one with
enough liquor to make him ugly, refuses to show his
pass, and even attempts to seize the gun of the guard,
when most unexpectedly, he receives the butt of the
musket in his face, and, beginning to realize that
"discretion is the better part of valor," submits, and
is led off, a soberer and wiser man.</p>

<p>When some of the old New York and Pennsylvania
regiments were encamped near the town, their
men were very apt to make trouble during their visits
to Newbern, and it often ended in their passing the
night at the guard-house. One afternoon, two six-foot
Irishmen came over the bridge, and on entering the
town, refused to show their passes. Both had guns
and bayonets, and threatened to kill any one who should
attempt to arrest them. It was not until aid arrived
from the guard-house, and they had been stretched out
with the butt of a pistol, that they quieted down and
consented to go and be locked up. Once we were
stopped in the street by a native, and asked to come
and arrest a drunken fellow, who had threatened to
stab his wife, the niece of my informant. Although
unaccustomed to interfere in family troubles, such
a summons could not be neglected. The man was a
citizen of Newbern, and on our arrival was asleep
on a sofa, while the poor wife was weeping in the
cook-house. Arousing him, we made known our
errand; and the accusations and tears of the wife,
together with the maudlin stupidity of the man, were
pitiful to witness. It is to be hoped that three day's
solitary confinement, on bread and water, brought him
to a realizing sense of his conjugal duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, a person just arrived from Fortress Monroe,
made complaint at the provost marshal's, of the
theft of some of his baggage by one of the hands
employed on the steamer. A guard was immediately
sent to the steamer to arrest the criminal, and a portion
of the stolen goods was found among the effects
of one of the firemen, but the man himself was missing.
Feeling convinced however, that the fellow was
concealed somewhere on the vessel, they commenced
a search, high and low, for the guilty one, and just as
they were about to give up in despair, one of the
guard chanced to look under one of the boilers, and
there discovered the culprit, squeezed in almost out of
sight. On being requested to come forth, he refused
flatly, and being out of reach he could not be dragged
out. A loaded pistol was produced, and aimed at
his head, when some one suggested the hose, and a
stream of dirty water was quickly brought to bear on
the hapless victim. In vain did he squirm and writhe;
he had to succumb, and finally crawled out from his
hiding-place more dead than alive, and was carried in
triumph to the guard-house to answer for his sins.</p>

<p>We were by no means idle on the days off guard.
Four times a week, when the weather permitted,&mdash;and
the days were rare when it did not permit,&mdash;we were
indulged in the delights of brigade drill. Coming off
guard at ten o'clock, the order would sound through
the yard, immediately after dinner, which was earlier
on those days, "Fall in for brigade drill, blouses and
caps!" and at noon we formed regimental line on
Broad street, and from there marched a long two miles
over the railroad bridge, to the plain near our old barracks
on the Trent.  Here we were joined by the 17th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
43d and 51st Mass., and man&oelig;uvred by Colonel
Amory for two or three hours. "Echelon by battalion
at forty paces," "form line of battle on third
battalion, right in front," etc., became as familiar as
household words, and all of us felt competent to handle
a brigade. Still it was always a happy moment
when we saw our commander sheathe his long sabre,
and no order was obeyed with such celerity and precision,
as the one which invariably followed this action,
"march off your battalions." The men were always
in the best of spirits on the march back to town, and
many a song and joke beguiled the weary way.</p>

<p>Twice a week, also, we had battalion drill, sometimes
in the streets, and occasionally in one of the
fields on the outskirts of the town. As we were very
apt to have spectators during our street drills, the
colonel was especially vexed at any blunders committed
by the officers, and woe betide the unfortunate
one who incurred his censure on those days, for he
spoke his mind on the spot, to the great delight of the
file, and the discomfiture of the rank.</p>

<p>But all this drill was not thrown away, and for accuracy
and quickness of movements, we yielded the
palm to no regiment in the department. The great
feature of the day, however, was the dress-parade.
Every afternoon, a little before five o'clock, there was
a general struggle for blacking and brushes, "dress
coats and hats" being the countersign for the hour.
Nightly, with our white gloves and good clothes, we
formed company in the back yard, where we had a
preliminary drill in the manual, to get our hand in for
the show performance. Then off we marched to the
parade-ground on the next street, occasionally going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
through with a battalion drill, on our own account,
while on the way to our place in line.</p>

<p>The regiment stretches along the north side of the
street and the colonel takes his station on the opposite
sidewalk, which is regularly occupied by a long row of
lookers-on. Here, as elsewhere, our company was in
good luck, having the centre of the line, and as the
best drilling was to be seen there, it was accordingly
directly opposite the fair faces, who deigned to grace
our parade with their presence. Many thanks, fair
ladies, for the innocent pleasure your bright faces
afforded us poor fellows, many of whom, for eight
weary months, did not so much as speak to a lady.
Nor was your presence simply a pleasure but a benefit
to the regiment; for what man could look aught but
neat and tidy with such eyes to criticise? who would
not excel in drill to win applause from such lips?</p>

<p>When, occasionally, the familiar face of some Boston
gentleman appeared in the crowd, it was pleasant
to see the start of amazement with which he greeted
the first strains of music as the band beat down the
line. Could these be the same men who labored so
hard at Readville to produce some semblance to
music? The band had indeed improved wonderfully,
and it was now a positive pleasure to hear them play.
Guard-mounting and dress-parade, from being a
decided bore, had come to be really enjoyable. Nothing
is more enlivening and inspiriting than good martial
music; it relieves the monotony of all military
parades, and refreshes the weary both in body and
soul. When one is exhausted with marching, and to
drag one leg after the other is a sore task, let the band
strike up, and the inspiring sounds infuse new life into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the tired frame; it makes the way look short and easy,
which, but the moment before, had seemed interminable.
Nor were the duties of the band confined to
the department of music; for on the field of battle
they did excellent work as members of the ambulance
corps, and all who had need of their assistance will
remember with unceasing gratitude their kind service
and tender care.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
THE GRAND REVIEW.</h2>


<p>It was our good fortune during our stay in Newbern,
to participate in a grand review of the
18th Army Corps by our commander, General
Foster. We had due notice, and were gotten up in a
state of blackness and brightness well nigh bordering
on perfection. Blackness having reference to the
state of our boots and equipments, brightness to
our guns and brasses. The cleansing and polishing
and furbishing one does in the army is beyond belief,
for by the time you have come to the end of the long
list of articles which require touching up, the first
strap or brass, as the case may be, has become dull,
and you begin again;&mdash;but to return to the review.</p>

<p>The day was all that could be desired, bright and
beautiful, and as the regiment formed line on the
parade-ground, looking so neat and nice, with colors
flying, and the band outdoing itself in the excitement
of the day, we felt proud of our State and the service
which enlisted such men in its ranks.</p>

<p>The review was on the south side of the Trent, the
country there affording splendid facilities for military
man&oelig;uvres on a large scale, as it presented an unbroken
stretch of nearly two miles in each direction. We
were well acquainted with the spot, having trodden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
almost every foot of land thereabouts in our numerous
brigade drills, and were first on the ground that
day, as befitted our position in line, the Forty-fifth
ranking as 1st Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Division,
18th Army Corps.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sight to watch the long line of
troops which filed over the bridge, their bayonets
flashing in the sunlight, as regiment after regiment
came up and took its place in line. The line was
formed in brigades, four regiments deep, in the order
of the brigades, our brigade holding the right, the
artillery and cavalry occupying the extreme left.</p>

<p>The thunder of the artillery announced the arrival
of our gallant commander, Major-General Foster, and
soon he appeared at our front, finely mounted, and
attended by his full staff. Drums are ruffled and arms
presented, while the band plays "Hail to the Chief,"
as he dashes along in his inspection of each regiment,
the music continuing while he is passing through the
brigade, then the next band takes up the strain.</p>

<p>After a long rest and a lunch by all who had been
prudent enough to bring a supply of hard-tack in
their pockets, our turn came for an active part in the
proceedings of the day. General Foster had taken
his station on a slight eminence, and sat facing the
centre of the line, which, brigade deep, extended for
full a mile. Surrounded by his staff, he was the object
of attraction of the crowd of spectators who thronged
about him, from Mrs. Foster and her brilliant staff
of ladies, down to the most ragged contraband in all
that motley assembly.</p>

<p>As we wheeled by platoons and marched in review,
the sight which greeted us was one long to be remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for its grandeur and beauty. Line upon line of
unbroken ranks stretched on as far as the eye could
reach. Over each regiment waved our beautiful flag,
its colors glowing with unwonted richness in the warm
winter's sun, the bayonets throwing back flashes of
light, and the artillery and cavalry relieving the scene
from all monotony, while the Neuse, sparkling in the
sunlight, and its distant bank covered with the forest
evergreen, formed a perfect background for this gorgeous
picture. Then there was the long row of spectators,
some, seated in vehicles of all sorts and descriptions,
others, mounted on animals ranging from the
finest charger to the scrubbiest donkey, while on foot
was a crowd composed of every age, sex and color.
In their midst sat our commander, patiently awaiting
our approach.</p>

<p>As we drew near, the band filed off to the left,
and took its position directly opposite the general,
where it continued playing till our brigade had all
passed, when it was relieved by the next band, and
once more took its place in line. As each platoon
passed, the general saluted, while he honored the
colors by removing his hat, the band also giving the
customary salute. Battalion after battalion, battery
after battery, troop after troop, they came, till the first
battalion, making the complete circuit, came upon the
rear of the last troop, thus forming an unbroken circle.
As each regiment reached the place of starting, it
halted until the long, glittering array was once more
in position, then again the artillery thundered forth
the salute, and the grand review was over.</p>

<p>Not long after this we were gladdened by the arrival
of a party of ladies and gentlemen, friends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
regiment, and those amongst us who were not personally
acquainted with any of the visitors, were, notwithstanding,
pleased to see the familiar faces, and
witness the joy of those who were made happy in
their coming. We were favored on the next Sunday
by a sermon from Dr. Lothrop, of Boston, who was
one of the party, and it seemed strange indeed to
listen to him there, preaching in a southern pulpit to
an audience of soldiers. The Presbyterian church
was the one occupied by us, and our chaplain held
service there every Sunday afternoon, the regiment
and visitors filling the body of the house. It was
a plain, old-fashioned building, with a high pulpit and
small organ.</p>

<p>The Episcopal church was open in the morning,
Major Sturgis, in the absence of the rector, reading
the service and a sermon. The singing by a quartette
of male voices, two from our regiment, and two
on detailed service in the city, would have shamed
most northern choirs. The church was built of stone,
and was very prettily situated on Pollock street, standing
back from the street, in an old burying-ground
filled with elms and willows and moss-covered tombstones.
The interior of the building was finished in
very good taste, and there was a fair organ, which we
often went up into the organ-loft to listen to, as one
of the musicians of our company had access to the
building. A Sunday school was also started during
our stay in town, and was very successful, increasing
rapidly in size and influence.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable service it was our lot ever
to witness, was one held in the contraband Methodist
church. A small party of us, having obtained passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
started one Sunday for the church in the Second District,
and on entering the building, found the galleries
were reserved for visitors and already well filled with
soldiers, drawn there, like ourselves, by curiosity. The
body of the house was crowded with the congregation
of worshippers, the women occupying one side of the
church, the men the other. Every shade of color
from that of Erebus, god of night, to fair-haired
Aurora, child of the morning, was there represented,
while the bright colors which adorned the female portion
of the house, added to the brilliancy of the scene.</p>

<p>The pulpit was unoccupied, but the leader of the
meeting, an intelligent looking man, nearly white,
and with, what was remarkable, sandy hair, sat in
a chair in front of the pulpit. He opened the service
with singing, reading a line from the hymn, which
was then sung by the congregation; then reading the
second line, and so on. Having heard so much of
the melody of the negro, and the beautiful singing
to be heard on the plantations, our expectations were
highly raised, but, alas! no sooner had the first note
reached our ears, than our hopes were dashed to the
ground. Imagine some old psalm tune, screamed
forth, line by line, from the cracked throats of the old,
and by the shrill voices of the young, all singing the
air, each voice pitched on a different key, and some
idea of their style of music may be formed.</p>

<p>Next came a prayer, in which the voice of the
leader was for the most part drowned in the vigorous
groans of the congregation, except when it rose to a
shout and was heard above the din around him. The
audience having warmed to the subject, he began to
exhort them to repentance. Meantime, two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
women throwing their bonnets and shawls on the pulpit
stairs, evidently preparing for work, began with as
many men, pillars of the church, to move about among
the congregation, addressing a word here and there
to enforce the preacher's remarks.</p>

<p>Several soon began to feel the arrow of conviction,
and were led up in front of the pulpit, where the girls
were stripped of shawls and bonnets, which were
thrown in a heap on the stairs. The cause of this
strange proceeding soon became apparent, for the
poor creatures, excited and wrought into a state of
frenzy by the words of the speakers, began to scream
and shriek, struggling with those who were exhorting
them, shouting, "Save me now," at the top of their
lungs, until they fairly went into convulsions.</p>

<p>One poor girl, not more than sixteen or seventeen
years old, struggled and screamed for more than an
hour in a most frightful manner, until at length she
sank on the floor utterly exhausted by her violence.
It was the same on the men's side, though they were
less violent in their emotions, but when the excitement
was at its height, it seemed as though Bedlam itself
was let loose. The scene was at once ludicrous and
saddening. It was sad to think these poor creatures
could hope to win salvation in such a manner, yet at
the same time, the absurdity and comicality of the
whole affair was irresistible, and showed a phase of
negro character both strange and amusing.</p>

<p>As the season advanced, the weather became most
delightful. The buds began to swell and the flowers
to peep up here and there, until we soon found ourselves
living in a great garden. Almost every house
had some land about it, and our own quarters were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
surrounded by rose trees, violets and other plants too
numerous to mention. The air teemed with fragrance
from the blossoms of the apple, peach and pear trees
which grew back of the house; little green figs began
to make their appearance, and the elms which filled
the streets once more donned their summer covering,
while our ears were delighted with the song of the
mocking-birds and most of our northern songsters.</p>

<p>Every letter sent northwards was freighted with a
little offering of flowers, whose sweetness still lingered
about the paper even after their freshness had passed
away, and gave to friends at home some token of
that summer we were enjoying, but which to them
was still far distant. Pitching quoits, or rather horseshoes,
was the great amusement of the day, and
engrossed the leisure hours alike of officers and men.
Base ball also had its share of attention, and a small
set of gymnastic apparatus was set up in the yard.
Some of us, occasionally, passed a morning hour in
teaching; for shortly after the arrival of the chaplain's
wife, a day school was opened under her auspices for
the contrabands. It was more especially intended for
children, but was open to all of a more advanced age,
who were anxious to learn.</p>

<p>The school was held daily for an hour in the
colored church on Hancock street, the teachers being
for the most part, men of our regiment, assisted by
two or three ladies, who interested themselves in the
work. The scholars were, as a rule, quite bright and
very eager to learn, and seemed much delighted
with their primers and spelling-books. Their progress
in reading was quite rapid, their eagerness to
acquire the knowledge from which they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hitherto barred, overcoming all obstacles. The young
ones were sometimes seen going over their lessons
at home for the edification of the older ones, who
were unable to attend the school, thus bringing a
double blessing on the labors of the teacher. After
we left Newbern and once more went into camp, the
chaplain opened a school there for the benefit of the
contraband settlement near by, which was kept up till
our departure, and was not without good results.</p>

<p>The receipt of frequent mails and occasional boxes
from home, served as pleasant little episodes, oases in
the desert of our life of drill and guard. The joy
which beamed on the countenances of those who read
their names in staring letters on the boxes found piled
up in the yard, on returning from drill, was amusing
to behold, and showed that the appetite for home
cookery was not wholly destroyed by long neglect.</p>

<p>The mail steamers made known their approach by
blowing three whistles when some distance down the
river, and, no sooner was the signal heard, than cries
of "Dudley Buck!" "Ellen Terry!" "Mail! Mail!"
would resound through the quarters, and some of the
more enterprising ones would travel down to the
wharf to count the number of mail bags, for our
expectations were gauged by the number of bags.
After two or three hours of impatient waiting, the
orderly would go over to the regimental post-office,
which was under the charge of the chaplain, and
quickly return loaded down with the precious freight.</p>

<p>Then the answers must be written immediately, for
the mail boats made but little stay, and the notice on
the post-office announcing the hour of mail closing,
is frequently consulted, for it had a way of changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
from hour to hour, which was apt to be embarrassing.
Permission to keep the lights burning after taps is
obtained, and the table in those rooms that boast such
a luxury, is surrounded by busy writers. The more
prudent ones, who have already mailed their letters,
turn into their bunks in the vain hope of profiting
by their forethought by getting an extra amount of
sleep, but the light and noise prove too much for
them, and they amuse and revenge themselves by
annoying and worrying the writers. The result is,
that a riot, in a small way, is pretty sure to follow,
which ends in the appearance of the captain, and the
extinction of the lights, when the prudent ones once
more turn in, chuckling over their triumph. Their
rejoicing, however, is ill-timed, for the others, baffled
in their attempts to write, determine that no one shall
sleep till they see fit, and by noise and talk keep their
poor victims on the rack, till, wearied out at last,
silence at last reigns over the scene of confusion, and
sweet sleep and dreams of home descend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
THE FOURTEENTH OF MARCH.</h2>


<p>It was General Foster's intention to celebrate the
anniversary of the battle of Newbern, and the
capture of the town, by a parade of the troops
in and about the city, and orders to that effect had
been issued to the different commanders. But a slight
circumstance occurred on the day previous to the
anniversary, which caused an entire change in the
programme.</p>

<p>We had often heard from prisoners the boast that
Newbern should not remain in our possession for
more than a year, and, sure enough, on the 13th, the
pickets were driven in, and, instead of a parade, there
seemed to be every prospect of a fight. All were
actively engaged in preparation for whatever the morrow
might bring forth. Aides and orderlies were galloping
through the streets, and ammunition wagons
carrying supplies to the various forts, while the natives
hung about the corners with ill-suppressed looks of
exultation on their yellow faces, eagerly listening to
the scraps of news which the passing soldiers let fall.
Cartridges were given out, and the guns of the guard,
contrary to custom, were loaded, and strict orders
given to arrest any who breathed even the faintest
suspicion of treason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>After a restless night, we were aroused early on the
morning of the 14th by the booming of cannon and
bursting of shells, and quickly started out to learn the
immediate condition of affairs. The eastern bank of
the Neuse, for some miles above and below the town,
is covered with an impenetrable swamp. There is,
however, one approach by a road from Little Washington,
which strikes the river about a mile above the
upper end of the town, and, in old times, a ferry-boat
plied the river at this point. This ferry had fallen
into disuse, as our communications with Washington
were wholly by water, but the importance of securing
this approach, and preventing any surprise in that
direction, had not been overlooked, and, for some time
past, there had been a picket-station across the river.
This was now occupied by the 92d New York, who
had been busily engaged in throwing up a strong
earthwork, commanding the road, but as yet no guns
had been mounted.</p>

<p>We soon discovered that this camp was the point
of attack, and nothing but the cowardice of the enemy,
and the bravery of the 92d, saved the latter from capture
or destruction. At an early hour, their pickets
had been driven in, and soon after daybreak the
enemy appeared, about an eighth of a mile from the
earthwork, with a force of some five thousand infantry
and cavalry, and sixteen pieces of artillery. Imagine
the situation; between three and four hundred men
armed only with muskets, confronted by a force of
more than ten to one. Protected, it is true, by earthworks,
but without a gun mounted, while behind them
stretched a mile and a half of water, separating them
from friends and safety; and about a mile down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
river, half hidden in the morning mist, lay the gun-boat
"Hunchback," unconscious of the threatened
danger.</p>

<p>The rebel general sends a summons to surrender,
which is met some distance from the works to prevent
too close an inspection of their weakness, and is
answered by the brave commander with an "If you
want the place, you must come and take it." No
sooner is this reply received than the ball is opened.
But the first boom of the cannon is a signal of alarm
to friendly ears across the river; it startles the
sleepers on the gun-boat and arouses the people in
the city.</p>

<p>Thick and fast the storm of shot and shell pours in
upon the devoted little garrison. Tents are riddled,
shanties knocked in pieces, but the men themselves,
lying close behind their entrenchments are, as yet,
unharmed. Can they hold out till rescue comes, or
will the enemy carry the works by storm? is the anxious
thought of every heart, as with straining eyes
they watch the signs of life now discernable on the
gun-boat, on which their hopes depend. At last the
smoke curls up from the tall pipe and the old "Hunchback"
moves slowly to the rescue. Like the passing
vessel, which has seen the signal of the shipwrecked
mariner and is gradually lessening the distance between
him and a watery grave, so the gun-boat,
steaming up the river, comes between the little garrison
and captivity in a southern prison. As she neared
the scene of action and her hundred pounder opened
upon the enemy, their hopes of success were gone
forever.</p>

<p>Mounted in the rigging of a schooner lying at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
provost-marshal's wharf, glass in hand, we watched
the combatants. Our flag floated proudly over the
works, and the smoke of the rebel guns was quickly
followed by the explosion of the shells, now over the
camp, now in the river, one or two even striking
upon our side of the Neuse. A revenue schooner,
also, was beating up the river, anxious to join in the
fight, but the hundred pounder of the "Hunchback"
proved too much for the visitors. With one gun dismounted
by a shot from the gun-boat, and a loss of
several killed and wounded, they retired discomfited
into the woods, whence they sent an occasional shot
at the prize which had been so unceremoniously
snatched from their very grasp. The revenue vessel,
of lighter draft than the gun-boat, ran in close to shore
and anchored off the brave garrison, and all danger in
that quarter was at an end.</p>

<p>Simultaneous attacks were also made on the outposts
at Deep Gully and Batchelder's Creek, but were
attended with no better success; so, baffled at all
points, the foe gave up the attempt and retired in
the direction of Kinston and Little Washington.
In honor of our victory, and out of compliment to the
enemy, General Foster had the Stars and Stripes
hoisted to the very summit of the Episcopal steeple,
the highest point in the city, where, visible for miles
in every direction, they floated in proud defiance over
the place in which one year before had drooped the
tricolor of treason and rebellion.</p>

<p>The hope and exultation so visible that morning in
the faces of the traitorous inhabitants, gradually paled
into a yellower despair than ever, and the stores of
provisions prepared by them in anticipation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
speedy coming of their friends, ferreted from their
concealment by the vigilance of the detectives, met
with an untimely end. The town soon recovered
from the excitement caused by this near approach of
the enemy, and we all enjoyed the occurrences of the
day as a pleasant variety in our rather monotonous
life.</p>

<p>But, while we were enjoying a life of comparative
comfort in Newbern, with unlimited credit at the sutler's,
relying on the arrival of the paymaster some
time in the future, other regiments in the department
were less fortunate. The siege of Little Washington
by the rebels began, and we listened daily to the
distant booming of cannon. But though regiment
after regiment was sent off, until only three or four
were left about the city, and the rest of our brigade
participated in General Spinola's fruitless attempt to
march overland to Washington, raise the siege, and
rescue General Foster from his uncomfortable, not to
say dangerous, situation, our regiment continued in
its old routine of guard duty, having besides special
charge of the city defences in the absence of the other
troops.</p>

<p>At last, on the night of April 16, General Foster
ran the blockade in the little steamer "Escort," not
without great danger to himself and the crew, for they
passed through a very hot fire, and the steamer was
struck in several places. The pilot was killed, and
one shot went through the coppers in the cook's
galley, taking off an arm of the cook in its passage;
another passed through the general's state-room, fortunately
unoccupied at the time. There was, of
course, great risk incurred in running by the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
batteries, for any injury to the machinery would have
insured capture or destruction, but the urgent need
for General Foster's presence in Newbern caused all
personal danger to be regarded as nothing in the service
of the country. No time was lost upon his arrival,
and that very day troops were on the way, some
by land, others by water, to the relief of the beleaguered
town, and before a week passed, the siege was
raised and the enemy had disappeared.</p>

<p>During the troubles above mentioned, a change was
made in our system of guard duty, and instead of having
sentry posts scattered about the town, squads of
men patrolled the streets four hours at a time. This
change was a great relief to the regiment, for thereby
the number of men required for daily duty was reduced
nearly two-thirds, and instead of going on guard every
other day as before, the turns now came but once
in four or five days. We got to know the town pretty
well in this way, for the patrol visited every street,
lane and alley in its wanderings by night as well as
day, and many curious scenes and places met our eyes,
which in ordinary life would never have been visible.</p>

<p>But pleasant things must have an end. Rumors
became prevalent through the regiment that we were
soon to be relieved, and the honorable duty of provost
guard to be assigned to the 44th Mass., as a
reward for their services at Little Washington. The
following order, read on dress-parade, confirmed
our fears:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Department of North Carolina</span>,}<br />

</div>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Special Order No. 117, No. 5.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In accordance with the custom of the Department, the regiment
now doing provost duty will be relieved. The commanding general,
on changing the guard of the town, desires to convey to
Colonel Codman, and through him, to his officers and men, his
high appreciation of the manner in which the duties of the guard
have been performed.</p>

<p>He has noticed with great pleasure the drill, discipline and
general efficiency of the regiment. The 44th Regiment, M. V. M.,
will relieve the 45th on Saturday, the 25th inst., at 9.00 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span></p>

<p>By command of Major-General Foster.</p>

<div class="right">
[Signed]      L. HOFFMAN, A. A. G.<br />

</blockquote>

<p>A very pleasant testimonial of the good feeling
which prevailed between the inhabitants of the town
and the regiment, was also received by the colonel,
which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

about to retire from the duty of guarding the city, I beg leave on
behalf of all loyal citizens, myself, my family, and other families
here, to render you our sincere thanks for the efficiency and courtesy
with which you have discharged your duties.</p>

<p>It has seldom been our lot to see a body of soldiers so uniformly
civil and gentlemanly in their behavior, temperate and orderly in
their habits, comparatively free from the prevailing vice of profanity,
and so prompt in restraining those who, by any violence, would
attempt to disturb our streets.</p>

<p>Accept, gentlemen, our thanks for past kindness, and wishes
for your future welfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The last two or three days of our sojourn in the
town, several ludicrous scenes occurred at the provost-marshal's,
in consequence of the revival of an old
order in respect to the uniform of the soldiers. It
had become the general custom of detailed men in
the various departments, to wear different articles of
an officer's uniform, everything in fact but shoulder
straps, rendering it impossible for the guard to
distinguish between officers and privates. An order
was therefore issued to the guard to deprive such
men of their superfluous ornaments, and in case they
refused to give them up, to conduct them to the guard-house.
So, every little while, some indignant fellow
would appear at the guard-house, escorted by a sentry,
and demand the meaning of such shameful treatment.</p>

<p>The question was commonly answered by the appropriation
of the forbidden finery by the officer in command,
after allowing the owner to peruse the order of
the provost-marshal, when he would retire from the
scene somewhat crestfallen. Two examples afforded
us especial mirth, the one a commissary sergeant, the
other, hospital steward of a certain Massachusetts regiment,
for their rage was something laughable, and
their impudence so great, that they were permitted to
spend the night in the guard-house as a reward.</p>

<p>The morning of the 25th dawned bright and pleasant,
and our numerous boxes and traps were piled up
in the yard, preparatory to being toted off in the funny
little mule-carts. Our quarters were all swept and
garnished, some of the rooms having been trimmed
with flowers in honor of the new comers. We took
our last breakfast at the Boston Lunch, and the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
relief of the new guard having been duly posted, we
bade farewell to the house which had sheltered us so
comfortably and pleasantly the past three months, and
joined the regimental line on Broad street, the scene
of so many guard-mountings, drills and dress-parades,
and now of the ceremony of tendering the command
of the city to our successors. Having conformed to
the requirements of military etiquette, we started for
our new home in the country, Camp Massachusetts,
on the banks of the Neuse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
A TRIP UP THE RAILROAD.</h2>


<p>The evening of our second day in camp, Sunday,
April 26, we received an unexpected
favor from General Foster, in the shape of an
order to march the next morning. The regiment was
quickly astir, for rations were to be made ready, cartridge-boxes
filled, and all those little preparations
gone through with which marching orders always
render necessary. After a while, quiet settles down,
and we turn in, determined to make sure of one more
good sleep at all events. We are roused at early
dawn by the roll of the drum; the roll is called, the
"Blind Girl" manages to fire off his rifle, fortunately
without injury to the bystanders, the regimental
line is formed, and we start for Newbern.</p>

<p>On arriving in town, it appears that the expedition
consists of the first division of infantry, accompanied
by a small force of cavalry and artillery, the destination
being somewhere in the direction of Kinston.
The Forty-Fifth meets with its usual good luck, for
our brigade is embarked on the cars, with orders to proceed
by rail as far as the track will allow, thereby
saving us a march of some eighteen miles, which the
other brigade is compelled to make. The whole force
was under the command of General Palmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>After the usual delay in getting men and horses
on board the cars, we moved slowly up the road, which,
passing through the camps and entrenchments surrounding
the town on this side, runs for miles in an
almost straight line through the pine forest, broken
here and there by a clearing, and an occasional picket
or signal station. After a ride of some twelve miles
we reached the outpost at Batchelder's Creek, then
held by the 58th Penn., Colonel Jones. Their camp
was surrounded by earthworks, and a strong blockhouse
commanded the railroad and bridge across the
creek, where a row of sharpened stakes presented an
ugly front to any hostile visitor.</p>

<p>The centre of attraction was, however, a railroad
monitor, which stood on a side-track. It was an iron-plated
baggage-car, with a peaked roof, the skylight
serving for an entrance, which was reached by a ladder
on the outside, removable in time of need. It carried
two rifled six-pounders, one at each end, for which
there were port-holes in the sides and ends of the car,
thus giving the gunners range both of the railroad and
surrounding country. The sides of the car were covered
with rifles, and pierced with loop-holes for their
use, the whole affair being surmounted by the old flag.
This formidable arm of the service accompanied us
to our camping-ground, where it remained during our
sojourn.</p>

<p>About six miles beyond Batchelder's Creek, we
were dumped from the platform cars, much after the
manner of dumping gravel, into an open field bordering
on a small stream, boasting the name of Core
Creek. The clearing extended on both sides of the
railroad, the farmer's house and barn forming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
prominent feature in the scene. These were immediately
placed under guard to prevent any depredation
by unlawful hands.</p>

<p>The family had not left the house, perhaps having
been wholly overcome by the unexpectedness of our
visit. The poor man had most unfortunately planted
his corn and grain, and there is great reason to fear
that a love for the Union did not prevail in his mind
when he beheld his crop trampled under the feet of
Union soldiers, and his nice rail fences vanish in the
smoke of their fires. No unnecessary damage was
inflicted, but when three or four regiments are encamped
for several days on a planted field, you cannot
expect very much of a harvest.</p>

<p>As the whole afternoon was before us, we at once
set to work to make our bivouac more than ordinarily
comfortable. Rails being the first requisite, we collected
quite a pile, and then commenced on our
shanty. Planting two rails firmly in the ground,
inclined towards each other and crossing a little at
the top in this manner X, we secured them in this
position with blanket straps, and the length of a rail
distant, planted two more in like manner. A rail laid
in the notches formed the ridge-pole of our house,
and rails slanted from this pole to the ground completed
the frame-work. The covering for the roof
consisted of our rubber blankets, making a waterproof
hut, of which we were very thankful before our
stay in that spot was over.</p>

<p>Our next care after completing the hut, was to procure
a good bed, which we soon accomplished by felling
two or three pines and lopping off the small
branches, these making a delightfully soft and springy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
mattress. After a very comfortable night's rest, we
amused ourselves in exploring the brook which ran
through a pleasant little vale close by the camp, and
idled about till noon. While wondering whether it
was not time for dinner, the drums began to sound
the "assembly," followed immediately by the summons
to "Fall in."</p>

<p>Colonel Amory having been compelled by sickness
to return to Newbern, the command devolved upon
Colonel Codman. Accompanied by a portion of
the 17th Mass., under Lieut.-Col. Fellows, we were
soon on our way up the railroad, preceded by two
companies of the 45th, under command of the major,
as a scouting party. A short distance beyond the
creek, we passed a small earth-work, where some
months before a body of rebels had been surrounded
and captured, and the <i>debris</i> of their camp still lay
scattered about.</p>

<p>The track had been partially relaid for some distance,
rendering the marching anything but pleasant,
as there was no path on the side of the track, owing
to the slippery, muddy condition of the steep banks.
Moreover, the weather was extremely warm, adding
much to the discomfort of the march, especially to
such as had been foolish enough to wear their overcoats.
Most of the men had eaten no dinner, and but
one or two of the wise ones had thought to bring anything
with them.</p>

<p>A mile or more from camp, we passed the bivouac
of the two companies who had been on picket duty
the previous night, and were now scouting in advance
of us. As we pushed forward, all the roads which
crossed the track were eagerly scanned for traces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the enemy or the column co-operating with us on the
Neuse road. But nothing was to be seen until, after
marching about six miles, we came upon the major,
who was awaiting our approach with his little battalion
at one of these cross-roads. He had discovered
a body of troops on the river-road, which was quickly
pronounced to be the other brigade.</p>

<p>The two companies which had been employed thus
far in the fatiguing duty of skirmishing through the
swampy country where the road ran, were left here
under command of the major, as a reserve, and we
hurried forward. The track had been wholly demolished
from this point as far on as we went. In some
places they had turned the whole body of the track,
rails and sleepers, into the ditch, while in others they
had burnt the sleepers, bending the rails in the fires.
We found this destruction of the track rather a benefit
than otherwise, for it gave us a smooth, level road,
free from obstructions, and much less wearisome to
march upon than where we were obliged to jump
from sleeper to sleeper.</p>

<p>As our skirmishers advanced, they drew the fire of
the enemy's pickets, who were ensconced behind little
breastworks made of sleepers. The rebels fell back
quickly as we came near, firing an occasional shot to
spread the alarm, which was replied to on our side,
but the distance was too great either to inflict or
receive damage. The latter part of the afternoon,
after some ten miles marching, we arrived at a large
clearing extending on both sides of the track. A
house and barn stood on a cross-road on the left,
and the Neuse road, separated by a single field from
the railroad, was on the right, and, as we subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
discovered, crossed the track a short distance beyond.
Here a halt was ordered, as, not four hundred yards
distant, an earth-work loomed up directly across the
track. It extended also for some distance to the left
into the woods, and was concealed by a sunken fence
and underbrush; the works also ran along the track
to guard against an attack from the Neuse road. A
squad of men sent to the house to make investigation,
soon returned with two prisoners, a man and a boy,
whom they had discovered making their escape from
the back of the house, and after a sharp chase had
captured and brought to the colonel. The old man
was so frightened at having fallen into the hands of
the Yankees, that very little was to be got from him.
He amused us by his answer when asked his age; he
said he did not know, for his house took fire once, and
his age was burnt up.</p>

<p>Unable to ascertain the strength of the enemy,
except that there was a "right smart heap," and uncertain
whether they had artillery or not, the colonel
decided, nevertheless, to advance without awaiting the
arrival of the other column. Accordingly, five companies
of the 45th filed off to the left, and deploying
as skirmishers, advanced through the field back of the
house, leaving the sixth company, Co. A, to guard the
colors, the 17th Mass. acting as reserve. The firing
soon became very brisk along the line of the works,
and the enemy's force was estimated at from three to
five hundred.</p>

<p>They did not, however, show themselves, and their
firing was so high that we concluded they must have
held their guns above their heads and fired at random,
in their fear of exposing themselves to northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
bullets. The colonel was in doubt as to the best
course to pursue, for we had no artillery and he feared
the rebels might have a masked battery. But as we
advanced nearer and nearer, without drawing anything
but musketry fire, it was deemed best to carry
the works by assault, without waiting for the artillery
which was with the other brigade. The order was
given to Lieut.-Col. Fellows, of the 17th, to advance
with his men and charge the works; but the captain
of Co. A did not like to have this honor taken out of
his hands, for we were in the advance; so, after some
talk, the task was delegated to him. Fixing bayonets,
and firing by platoons, we started on the run directly
up the track.</p>

<p>The works were two or three hundred yards distant,
and had the enemy possessed any artillery, our little
company would have suffered most disastrously. But
fortunately for us they had none, and at our advance
gave way and fled into the woods, greeting us with a
final volley as we leaped the ditch and took possession
of the entrenchments, where, in their haste, they had
left three of their comrades killed by our bullets. The
sight of those poor fellows, lying there so still and
motionless, made an indelible impression on the mind.
It gave us a new insight into the character of the men
we were contending with. There they lay, dressed in
miserable clothing, their haggard faces, long tangled
hair, and neglected beards giving them a wild, hardly
human appearance.</p>

<p>The head of the other column arrived just as
our victory was assured, but it was not thought best
to penetrate any farther on account of our nearness
to Kinston, only six miles distant, and not even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hold what we had gained. So, with a loss of one
killed and three or four wounded, we started on the
return march for camp, ten miles away. Night soon
fell, and, to increase the pleasure of the way, it
began to rain, gently at first, but soon with a vigor
which was, under the circumstances, anything but
agreeable.</p>

<p>Our situation was not an enviable one. In the
enemy's country, not knowing but they might return
at any moment with overpowering numbers; between
us and camp a ten-mile's march on a partially demolished
track, through thick darkness and a pelting rain.
Remembering, however, that "what can't be cured
must be endured," we trudged bravely on through the
black night, regardless of rank or file, stumbling over
the remains of the track, and only anxious to end our
trials as soon as possible by a vigorous use of our legs.</p>

<p>Most of us had eaten nothing since morning, and
one or two fairly fainted from hunger and exhaustion.
Having pretty good legs of our own, we arrived at
camp about nine o'clock, among the first, drenched to
the skin and too tired to eat or sleep. Other poor
fellows were not so fortunate, but came straggling in,
in groups of two and three all through the night, some
not getting in till the next morning. The march
told very severely on some of the field officers who
had been unable to take their horses, and were unused
to such exercise; and we always felt that the colonel
was more lenient to the men after that practical experience
of a march.</p>

<p>We remained quietly in camp the next day, though
the pioneers were at work on the railroad, apparently
engaged in its reconstruction. But only apparently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
for the object of our expedition was to retain any
force the enemy might have at Kinston in that
vicinity, and prevent them from giving assistance to
the troops then threatening General Dix at Suffolk.
A portion of the 43d Mass. went up the railroad for
some distance to keep up the deception, returning the
same night.</p>

<p>We were most agreeably surprised here by the
receipt of a mail from home, which was brought up to
us, and by its help we managed to pass the day very
comfortably. After two very rainy nights, we were
once more packed on the platform cars and landed
directly at Camp Massachusetts, which lay close to
the railroad, where we quickly settled down to a life
of drill and stockading.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
CAMP MASSACHUSETTS.</h2>


<p>Our camp, which we left so unceremoniously
to go to Gum Swamp, was situated
on a large plantation, about a mile and a half
south of Newbern, and an eighth of a mile from the
Neuse. It was but a few rods from the railroad and
just outside a long line of earthworks which we were
to man in case of an attack from this quarter, they
being the outer line of works in this direction.</p>

<p>We found that the pioneers had been at work during
our absence, and the camp was already laid out in
streets, and some of the tents pitched. They were A
tents, eight feet square, and intended for four occupants,
though owing to the liberal supply many had
but three; however, no one was ever heard to complain
of a superabundance of room. Sunday was
anything but a day of rest, for, immediately after service,
there was a general stampede for the deserted
camps near by, to obtain flooring for the tents and
materials for stockading them.</p>

<p>These stockades were walls about three feet in
height, eight feet square, making a foundation for
the tent, and largely increasing the room and convenience.
They were built in every variety of style, some
of logs, after the fashion of log-houses, others with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rough clap-boards, pieces of boxes, in fact anything
that would answer the purpose of a board, an extremely
scarce article about camp. When the work
was completed the streets presented a very motley
appearance, no two being alike, the looks of each
stockade varying according to the skill of the builder.</p>

<p>The hours of grief which this herculean task of
stockading entailed upon the three unfortunates sheltered
by our canvass, will not soon be forgotten.
Our first sorrow was, finding on our return from up
country, that our upright posts, the corner stones
of our foundation, selected with the greatest care
and discrimination, indeed, perfect gems in their way,
and sawed off into proper lengths with much labor
and a dull saw, were missing, actually gone. An
undeniable judgment upon us for having found them
on Sunday. This was, however, but the beginning of
our sorrows. After many journeys back and forth
between our tent and the old camps, sufficient materials
were again collected on which to commence
operations.</p>

<p>With careful measurement and seeming accuracy,
the places for the uprights were marked and the holes
dug. It is due to the soil of North Carolina to say
that if there was one easy thing about stockading it
was this same digging holes. It reminded us of our
younger days, when the sand-heaps which lay before
unfinished houses were the undisputed territory of
the children of the neighborhood, and castles, caves,
bridges and tunnels grew under the busy hands of the
young builders. Our camp was located on a sandy
plain, no doubt made expressly for digging holes,
whether for posts or earthworks, it mattered not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Having erected the posts, we next proceeded to
make the walls of our house. First, the sutler had
no nails, and we had to wait half a day for those.
The company boasts two saws and three hatchets;
you spend five minutes in going up and down the
street in a vain attempt to borrow either the one or
the other; they are all in use; you wait in idleness for
ten minutes and try again. There is no need of
wasting breath in making known your errand,&mdash;the
unhappy owners of the coveted articles are visited on
the average by some eight or ten applicants in as
many minutes,&mdash;a look is sufficient.</p>

<p>At last you espy a saw lying idle, and immediately
pounce on it and rush to your tent. Three sticks are
sawed, and you are just getting your hand in when
you are confronted by the injured man who indignantly
demands his property, which you are constrained
with a bad grace to deliver. The same scene
is enacted with the hammer; and having spent as much
time as a contractor would ask to build a house, the
sides are at last completed and placed in position.
The fact is undeniable,&mdash;they look very rough and unworkmanlike;
however, we put the best foot forward,
and the worst looking side at the back, where we
flatter ourselves it will not be seen.</p>

<p>At length the frame is ready to receive the roof,
and in an agony of doubts and fears, after some
effort, we raise the tent to its place, and&mdash;find that
our frame is too large for the tent, or, rather, the tent
is too small for the frame; at all events, it is no go.
However, by dint of pulling and twisting and sawing,
we drag the refractory edges together, and with our
tent-poles at an angle of forty-five degrees, and presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a most unstable appearance, we enter our new
abode in triumph. We have stockaded.</p>

<p>The old camp life of drill and guard was re-enacted
here, with an additional task, by way of variety, entitled
fatigue-duty, which was neither more nor less,
than spending the day in the trenches, with a spade
for a companion, an occupation on a hot summer's
day the reverse of delightful. Battalion drills and
company drills followed each other in quick succession,
but as the one was early in the morning, and
the other late in the afternoon, we had a good portion
of the day to ourselves, and many were the shifts to
fill up the long interval.</p>

<p>The customary occupation in the morning, when
the weather permitted, was a swim in the Neuse.
After morning drill, it was usually the way to go to
guard-mounting and hear the band play. Then it
was time to bathe, for we were obliged by orders to
go in at ten, or thereabouts, and only once a day, but
this increased the sport by bringing a good many into
the water at the same time. Our road to the river lay
directly past the regimental hospital, most beautifully
situated in a grove of magnificent mulberry trees, as
large as English elms, and so thick-leaved as to make
a perfect shade tree. The hospital tent was pitched
under one of them, the farm-house of the plantation
being also occupied for a hospital; and near by was
the quartermaster's building, while within a stone's
throw stood Fort Spinola.</p>

<p>The fort was built directly on the river-bank, and
commanded, with its black-mouthed cannon, both the
river and the surrounding country for more than a
mile in every direction. On our arrival at Camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Massachusetts, the fort was garrisoned by Co. G, of
our regiment, who, having practiced heavy artillery
drill at Fort Macon, were summoned to its defence
in the early part of April, when an attack on the
city was apprehended. Soon after our advent, Co. I
returned from Fort Macon and took the place of Co.
G at Fort Spinola, so that, after an interval of six
months, the whole regiment was once more united
under one command.</p>

<p>Just by the fort there was a long wharf, running
into deep water, for the slope of the river-bed is very
gradual, and this wharf was, so to speak, the headquarters
of the bathers. Here were unlimited opportunities
for swimming, diving, etc., while those who
preferred shallower water had the whole river-bank
to wade from. One of the men actually swam across
the river one day, without making known his purpose.
He not only reached the opposite side, but had started
on his way back when he was picked up by a boat
which was sent after him. As the river is fully two
miles wide at this point, it was, to say the least, quite
a swim.</p>

<p>The quartermaster's boat lay at this wharf, for all
the light stores were brought from Newbern by water,
the heavier ones coming in the cars. The boat was
manned by a detailed crew, exempt from all other
duty, but as the officers made frequent use of the boat
to go to the city at all hours of the day and night,
the position was no sinecure. We poor soldiers who
were blessed with occasional furloughs to visit the
great centre of attraction, were sometimes honored by
an humble seat in the bow, for which we were duly
grateful, being thereby saved a long and dusty walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>As the season advanced, and the summer sun grew
hotter and hotter, the blackberry vines, which grew in
great profusion around the camp, began to exhibit a
pleasing appearance of redness, which indicated a not
distant day of ripeness. Hearing certain stories about
a discovery which had been made in some fields not
a great way off, two or three of us started out one
day, dippers in hand, and, after a diligent search, were
amply rewarded for our pains by a dish of delicious
wild strawberries. Not content with this luxury, the
colored people near by must needs bring round, just at
dinner time, some nice ice-cream, and, compelled by
the force of circumstances, we had a dessert of strawberries
and ice-cream. We often repeated this experiment
while the little red beauties were to be found,
and before they had fairly disappeared another fruit
had ripened.</p>

<p>The blackberries had passed from the red era, and
acres upon acres were covered with the long trailing
vines, thickly laden with the luscious fruit. There
was a continuous feast among the regiments encamped
in that neighborhood while the season lasted, and during
that time it was our regular amusement to spend
an hour or two daily in blackberrying,&mdash;a pleasant
task, for a sure reward awaited us at the termination
of our labors.</p>

<p>A favorite place to visit was the Newbern battle-field,
some three miles below our camp, and one
bright May morning some four or five of us started
off for the day in that direction. Instead of taking
the direct road which ran close by the camp, we determined
to go down the river bank. Passing through
the camp of the 1st North Carolina, colored, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
some time after, did such good service at Olustee,
we lingered a moment to watch them drill. After
admiring their powers of imitation, and, at the same
time, enjoying some most ludicrous blunders, we soon
found ourselves on the borders of the river.</p>

<p>The nature of the country was very different from
what we had been led to expect, consisting of a series
of bluffs and deep valleys, similar in formation to
those on the Mississippi. As we approached the
main line of earthworks, we found indications of rebel
fortifications on these heights; old gun-carriages, sandbags,
and all the <i>debris</i> of a deserted camp lay about
in hopeless ruin. They had evidently feared we would
approach by the river, and we soon came upon the
remains of the blockade, consisting of sunken vessels,
some of which had been raised and towed up to Newbern,
thus opening the channel.</p>

<p>We followed a pleasant little path through the
woods for some distance, catching occasional glimpses
of the river through the trees, as it sparkled in the
bright sunlight, and at length came out at the rebel
earthworks, the scene of the battle when Newbern
was won. The works extend from the west side of
the railroad directly to the river's edge, where they
terminate in a small fort which commands the river,
and which we found filled with the ruins of camp
equipage of every description abandoned by the rebels
in their hurried flight.</p>

<p>The 8th Mass. were doing picket duty at this point,
and apparently having a very easy time of it. As we
had all explored the ground two or three times before,
we hurried along the line of works till we struck the
Newbern road, where, instead of turning back to camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
we set our faces southward, hoping to obtain a dinner
at one of the houses which stand some way below the
battle-field. Crossing the broad cleared space over
which our troops had made their gallant charge, stopping
a moment to examine the traces of rebel bullets
in the trees and to marvel at the terrible havoc made
by the shells among the pines, we soon reached a lane
which led up to a house half hidden by the trees,
where we determined to try our fortune.</p>

<p>The usual group of negro shanties stood on the
lane, running over with little picaninnies, who gazed
at us with wondering eyes. The owner of the house
had gone to town to lay in a stock of provisions,
but his wife gave us a cordial welcome and promised
to do her best for us. We were soon summoned
to what was to us a most luxurious repast; the
mere fact of sitting down at a table was a pleasure,
and the strangeness of our surroundings enhanced
the enjoyment. Having taken our dessert in a mulberry
tree, the thought of the battalion drill awaiting
us at the end of our walk, hastened our departure
from this quiet spot, which was a delightful contrast
to the stir of camp-life, and seemingly far removed
from every thought of war. The lameness of the
master of the house had alone prevented him from
joining the army, as most of his neighbors had done.
We obtained an insight into southern life in this
way, which was new and interesting, and returned to
camp well pleased with our excursion.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May the regiment was reviewed by
the division commander, General Palmer, who expressed
much pleasure at the appearance of the men,
and particularly admired the looks of the guns. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was the custom during the mild May evenings, for
the singers to collect and give impromptu concerts,
and very often the band played for an hour in the
square in front of the colonel's tent, while on moonlight
nights, as we lay awake in our tents, we could hear
the mocking-birds in the grove by the hospital, making
night melodious with their songs.</p>

<p>There were two picket-stations connected with the
camp, one about a mile and a half down the river road,
prolific with mosquitos and wood-ticks; the other, and
by far the pleasanter, was at the railroad bridge which
spanned a broad creek not far from camp. The duty
at this spot was very light, and as the bridge was a
covered one, it was in fact the coolest spot anywhere
about camp, no small matter in that hot climate. Moreover,
the band came there to practice morning and
afternoon, having with commendable wisdom selected
this cool, shady place for that purpose. The days grew
hotter and hotter, and the drills proportionately shorter,
and we all began to look forward with wistful longing
to the day which should see us safely embarked for
home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
HOMEWARD BOUND.</h2>


<p>There had been stories about camp for a day
or more, of fighting at Batchelder's Creek,
and the death of Colonel Jones, of the 58th
Penn., was reported, but we had treated it as a mere
rumor. Our astonishment was great when, just before
roll-call Sunday evening, May 24th, the order was
given to the different companies to prepare for an
immediate departure to Batchelder's Creek. The train
stood in front of the camp awaiting us, and in twenty
minutes from the time the orders were received by
the colonel we were on the cars and off for the front.</p>

<p>When the regiment arrived at the picket-station
we found everything quiet, but the death of the
colonel was confirmed. Two of our companies were
immediately sent out on picket, and the rest of us
stretched ourselves on the parade-ground for the rest
of the night. It appeared that the 58th Penn., in
company with two or three other regiments, under
command of Colonel Jones, had made a raid up the
railroad, and, at the same earthworks we stormed the
month before, surprised and captured nearly two hundred
prisoners, besides a piece of artillery, baggage-wagons,
etc., the general in command barely escaping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The rebels, receiving large reinforcements from
Kinston, pressed closely upon our retiring column,
and its gallant commander was shot by a sharpshooter
just before reaching the camp. A fight ensued over
his body, which resulted in the repulse of the enemy,
and the 58th retired within their entrenchments, the
joy over their victory wholly overshadowed by the
loss of their colonel. The rebels, hearing doubtless
of the arrival of reinforcements, had fallen back in
the night, and as all fear of an attack was dissipated,
we started for our own camp about noon, taking the
body of Colonel Jones on the train to Newbern, there
to await transportation to his home in Philadelphia.
So ended our last expedition in North Carolina.</p>

<p>The following week we were summoned to escort
the body of Colonel Jones to the steamer from the
house of Captain Messinger, the provost-marshal, in
company with all the high officers in the department,
who were proud to do honor to the remains of a brave,
Christian soldier. After services at the boat we
marched back to camp, very tired and dusty, and
fully convinced that escort duty at a funeral was no
sinecure. The next day General Foster visited the
camp, and praising the regiment for its general satisfactory
conduct, strongly urged its re-enlistment in
his department. The time for such an appeal was
unfortunately chosen, just as the men were becoming
very weary of military duty, and anxious to see home
once more, and the response at the time was not very
hearty. But many did ultimately embrace the offer,
finding that the excitement of a soldier's life had
unfitted them for anything else.</p>

<p>The departure of the 43d and 44th Mass. naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
served to turn our thoughts northward, and we
did little else but discuss the chances of a speedy
return, talk of our reception, and lay wagers as to the
probable time of sailing, etc. As the weather grew
warmer, the climate began to have a marked effect
upon the health of the regiment. Drill was shortened,
and everything possible done to avert the evil;
but one after another sickened, until the regimental
hospital was crowded, and numbers were sent every
day or two to the hospital at Beaufort, to have the
benefit of the fresh sea-breeze.</p>

<p>But in vain. The sun beat hotter and hotter on those
little tents, until we lived, as it were, in a fiery furnace.
The sickness increased daily, and some poor fellows
passed on to their resting-place above, when almost
in reach of that earthly home towards which their
thoughts and dreams had so long been directed.
As one after another fell victims to the terrible fever,
we began to fear none would be left to return unless
the summons came quickly. After much weary waiting,
our hearts were rejoiced by the news of the
arrival at Morehead City of the steamers "Spaulding"
and "Tillie," prepared to transport us from the land of
sickness and sorrow to a more genial clime.</p>

<p>Our joy was somewhat lessened by the rumor that
we were ordered to report to General Dix, at Fortress
Monroe, and if needed, to join the force then operating
in the vicinity of the White House, Va.; but that was
as nothing in view of the fact that we were actually
homeward bound. The night before our departure
the following farewell order from General Foster was
read to the regiment:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Commanding General bids farewell to the officers and
soldiers of the 45th M. V. M., with the most sincere regret at
losing a regiment which has proved itself so good and deserving
in every position which it has been called upon to occupy. In the
various marches and fights they have exhibited that order, discipline,
experience and courage, which he hoped and expected to
find in an organization so worthily descended from the "Ancient
and Honorable Corps of Boston Cadets." For those who have
fallen in the fight or by disease, the General offers his sincere and
heartfelt sympathy to their comrades in arms, and to their bereaved
friends at home. To those who have survived the dangers, though
sharing them, the general bids God Speed!</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, the 24th of June, we broke
up our camp, leaving everything standing in expectation
of its speedy occupation by some other regiment,
and embarking on the cars, were hurried towards
Beaufort. There we found the vessels awaiting our
arrival at the same wharf at which we had landed
nearly eight months before, then a happy company,
full of life and health, eager to be at work in our
country's cause, but now a forlorn and weary number,
sick in body and mind, with scarce energy enough left
to realize that the hour for which we had longed and
prayed so many weary days had come at last.</p>

<p>Sick and well, we were all after a time embarked, and
in twenty-four hours were anchored off Fortress Monroe.
On mustering the available strength of the regiment,
it was found that out of about eight hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and sixty men but three hundred and fifty were fit for
active service. The colonel went on shore to report
the condition of the regiment, and, after some delay,
received orders from the War Department to proceed
with his command directly to Boston, so on Friday
afternoon we were once more headed homewards.
Most of us were too miserable to display our joy in
noisy mirth, but the spirits of the men brightened
visibly as the way grew shorter. Two of our number
passed away to their eternal home in that short passage,
and others survived the voyage only to die in
the arms of loved ones at home.</p>

<p>After a bright, calm passage, the "Spaulding"
steamed up Boston harbor early Monday morning,
the 29th of June, and was quickly boarded by a party
of friends who had been cruising about the harbor the
whole of the previous day in anticipation of our arrival.
After landing the numerous sick at the wharf, the vessel
again hauled out into the stream to await the arrival
of the "Tilly," which was but a poor sailor. The latter
steamer arrived so late in the afternoon that it was
deemed advisable to postpone the reception till the
following day. The poor fellows were consequently
condemned to pass another night on board of crowded
transports in full sight of their own homes.</p>

<p>Tuesday dawned as bright and pleasant as heart
could desire, and about nine o'clock the regiment
landed, and, escorted by the Cadets and Massachusetts
Rifle Club, proceeded <i>en route</i> for the State House.
After a reception by Governor Andrew, it marched
to the parade-ground and had a short battalion
drill, then, having had a collation, the men were
delivered into the arms of their expectant friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
After all these ceremonies had been gone through
with, the regiment went to the old camp at Readville,
and having turned over arms and equipments to the
quartermaster, were furloughed till the following Monday,
when they were mustered out of the United States
service, but neither paid nor discharged.</p>

<p>After enjoying the luxuries of home life for about
three weeks, the news of the New York riots came
upon us in all their horror and wickedness. Symptoms
of uneasiness betraying themselves in our own
city, a notice appeared in the papers signed by the
colonel, requesting the regiment to assemble at Readville
on Wednesday, the 15th of July, to aid in quelling
any disturbance that might arise. About two
hundred of the men obeyed this order, which, in the
scattered state of the regiment, was all that could be
hoped for on such an unexpected summons.</p>

<p>It seemed quite like old times, meeting once more
in the barracks, and making preparations for an expedition,
though the consciousness that this time we
were only bound to the city of Boston had a very
enlivening effect upon us all. The quartermaster
furnished us with arms, ammunition and equipments,
and, with our blankets slung in the old fashion, we
could very easily have imagined ourselves on the
point of starting off on a tramp up country from
Newbern.</p>

<p>Having formed in line, the colonel equalized the
companies, a rather important matter, as the Nantucket
company, Co. H, had but one representative
besides the officers, and the Cape Cod company, Co.
D, but four or five. We then went through a short
drill in street firing; and having loaded our guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with ball cartridges, started for the cars and were
deposited at the depot in town. Having executed the
order, "prime," with guns capped and at half-cock,
to show the bystanders and all interested that this
did not mean blank cartridges or holiday parade, we
marched to our quarters in Faneuil Hall.</p>

<p>This was the day following that of the Cooper
street riot, and as a renewed attack on Dock Square
and its gun-shops was expected that night, this, the
post of danger and honor, was assigned to the 45th,
as well as the support of four guns of the 11th Battery,
Capt. Jones. We were on duty through the
night, half of the regiment at a time, under command
of the lieutenant-colonel and major, a company being
assigned to each gun, they being placed one at each
corner of Faneuil Hall, thus commanding all the
streets converging upon Dock Square. There were
pickets out on all the neighboring streets, and no
persons, except market men, were permitted to enter
the square.</p>

<p>Strict orders were given to fire immediately on the
approach of any threatening body of people, and thus,
by a wise severity at the outset, to prevent such a prolongation
of outrages as had resulted from the misjudged
leniency of the New York authorities. The
night was passed very quietly, excepting some disturbance
from a noisy crowd in the evening, which was,
however, quickly dispersed by a patrol of dragoons.
A regular guard was stationed at the entrance of the
building, and there we had to stay throughout the
day, short furloughs of an hour or two being occasionally
granted. There is reason to fear, however,
that during the week spent in the hall a good many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
private furloughs were taken by way of the windows
and spouts, but as we were only on duty at night, it
mattered but little.</p>

<p>We continued to spend our nights in the open air,
generally in the Square, and on one or two occasions
detachments were sent to other points, South
Boston bridge, the armories, etc. Though the city
seemed to be restored to its pristine security, yet fearing
some outbreak on Saturday night or Sunday, we
were detained till the next Tuesday. It seemed very
strange to post sentries about the streets and alleys,
with orders to allow no one to pass through, and the
indignation of some of our worthy citizens at being
made to go some other way, was very amusing. Our
days were spent in watching the passers-by from the
windows, and one or two afternoons we were treated
to a battalion drill on the Common, in which we certainly
showed rather how much we had forgotten than
what we knew, for our mistakes were very numerous.
The gaping crowd were, however, none the wiser, and
doubtless thought them all a part of the show.</p>

<p>But all good things must sometime have an end,
and so did our rations of bologna sausage and Washington
pie, daily served out to us in the Cradle of
Liberty. The rioters thought better of their plans,
and wisely concluded that it was preferable to run the
risk of being drafted and then killed, than to be shot
down at their very doors; a fate they had every reason
to expect if they attempted any further disturbance of
the peace. Thanks to the prompt action of the state
and city authorities, the riotous proceedings were
nipped in the bud, and law and order again reigned
supreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The men had been dropping in to the rendezvous
from day to day, drawn from a distance by the summons,
until we numbered five hundred strong, and on
Monday night, knowing it would be the last time we
should be together as a regiment, we devoted the
evening, for we had no duty to perform that night, to
having a good time. We sang all the army songs till
we were tired out; cheered all the officers and everything
connected with the regiment, individually and
collectively, till we were hoarse, and made such a
scene as even old Faneuil Hall, in all her long history
of stirring events, had never witnessed the like of
before, and probably never will again.</p>

<p>Our task was ended, our nine months more than
full. Leaving behind us a name blotted by no stain
of dishonor, and with a proud consciousness of having
done honor to the noble State that gave us birth, having,
in camp and on the battle-field, striven to do our
duty by the government we had volunteered to serve,
on Tuesday, the twenty-first day of July, eighteen hundred
and sixty-three, we were paid off and discharged,
and the old Forty-Fifth lived only in history.</p>

<p>We had seen every variety of service, life in barracks,
in tents and in houses. Our losses in battle,
twenty killed and seventy-one wounded, outnumbered
that of all the other nine-month's regiments in the
department taken together, while our loss from disease
was very heavy. Our officers were worthy of
their commands, and the men worthy of their commanders.
Never, from the commencement of the war,
was an officer sent from the State better fitted for
the responsibilities of his position than our noble
colonel, Charles R. Codman. Perfect in his drill, firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in his discipline, yet free from all severity; brave in
the hour of danger, yet without rashness; loved, and
respected, he was truly a model officer. In the
coming years it will be the pride and boast of every
member of the 45th Mass. that he served for such a
country, in such a cause, from such a State, under
such a commander, in such a regiment.</p>
